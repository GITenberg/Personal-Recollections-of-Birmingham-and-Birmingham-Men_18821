  <p>These sketches, with the signature &quot;<i>S.D.R.</i>,&quot; were
  originally published in the <i>Birmingham Daily Mail</i> newspaper.
  The earliest were written, as their title indicated, entirely from
  memory. Afterwards, when the title was no longer strictly accurate,
  it was retained for the purpose of showing the connection of the
  series. It must be understood, however, that for many of the facts
  and dates in the later sketches the writer is indebted to others.</p>

  <p>The whole series has been very carefully revised, and some errors
  have been rectified. The writer would have preferred to remain
  <i>incognito</i>, but he is advised that, as the authorship is now
  generally known, it would be mere affectation to withhold his name.
  He hopes shortly to commence the publication of another series.</p>

  <h2><b>FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF BIRMINGHAM</b>.</h2>

  <p>It is a fine autumnal morning in the year 1837. I am sitting on
  the box seat of a stage coach, in the yard of the Bull-and-Mouth, St.
  Martin&#39;s-le-Grand, in the City of London. The splendid gray
  horses seem anxious to be off, but their heads are held by careful
  grooms. The metal fittings of the harness glitter in the early
  sunlight. Jew pedlar-boys offer me razors and penknives at prices
  unheard of in the shops. Porters bring carpet-bags and
  strange-looking packages of all sizes, and, to my great
  inconvenience, keep lifting up the foot-board, to deposit them in the
  &quot;front boot.&quot; A solemn-looking man, whose nose is
  preternaturally red, holds carefully a silver-mounted whip.
  Passengers arrive, and climb to the roof of the coach, before and
  behind, until we are &quot;full outside.&quot; Then the guard comes
  with a list, carefully checks off all our names, and retires to the
  booking office, from which a minute later he returns. He is this time
  accompanied by the coachman, who is a handsome, roguish-looking man.
  He wears a white hat, his boots are brilliantly polished, his drab
  great-coat is faultlessly clean, and the dark blue neckerchief is
  daintily tied. His whiskers are carefully brushed forward and curled,
  the flower in the button-hole is as fresh as if that instant plucked,
  and he has a look as if he were well fed, and in all other respects
  well cared for.</p>

  <p>Looking admiringly over the horses, and taking the whip from his
  satellite, who touches his hat as he gives it up, Jehu takes the
  reins in hand; mounts rapidly to his seat; adjusts the
  &quot;apron;&quot; glances backward; gets the signal from the guard,
  who has just jumped up&#8212;bugle in hand&#8212;behind; arranges the
  &quot;ribbons&quot; in his well-gloved hand; produces a sound,
  somehow, with his tongue, that would puzzle the most skilful printer
  in the world to print phonetically, but which a Pole or a Russian
  would possibly understand if printed &quot;tzchk;&quot; gently shakes
  the reins, and we are off.</p>

  <p>As we pass toward the gateway, the guard strikes up with the
  bugle, and makes the place resound with the well-known air,
  &quot;Off, off, said the stranger.&quot; Emerging upon the street, we
  see, issuing from an opposite gateway, a dozen omnibuses, driven by
  scarlet-coated coachmen, and laden entirely with scarlet-coated
  passengers. Each of these men is a &quot;general postman,&quot; and
  he is on his way to his &quot;beat.&quot; As the vehicle arrives at
  the most convenient point, he will alight and commence the
  &quot;morning&quot; delivery. The process will be repeated in the
  evening; and these two deliveries suffice, then, for all the
  &quot;country&quot; correspondence sent to London.</p>

  <p>Leaving them, our coach passes on through busy Aldersgate Street,
  where we are interrupted frequently by droves of sheep and numerous
  oxen on their way from Smithfield to the slaughter-houses of their
  purchasers. On through Goswell Street, alive with cries of
  &quot;milk&quot; and &quot;water creeses.&quot; On through Goswell
  Road; past Sadler&#39;s Wells; over the New River, then an open
  stream; and in a few minutes we pull up at &quot;The Angel.&quot;
  Here we take in some internal cargo. A lady of middle age, and of far
  beyond middle size, has &quot;booked inside,&quot; and is very
  desirous that a ban-box (without the &quot;d&quot;) should go inside,
  too. This the guard declines to allow, and this matter being
  otherwise arranged, on we go again. Through &quot;Merrie
  Islington&quot; to Highgate, where we pass under the great archway,
  then newly built; on to Barnet, where we stop to change horses, and
  where I stand up to have a look at my fellow outside passengers.
  There is not a lady amongst us. Coachman, guard, and passengers, we
  are fourteen. We all wear &quot;top&quot; hats, of which five are
  white; each hat, white or black, has its band of black crape. King
  William IV. was lately dead, and every decently dressed man in the
  country then wore some badge of mourning.</p>

  <p>During the whole of that long day we rattled on. Through sleepy
  towns and pleasant villages; past the barracks at Weedon, near which
  we cross a newly-built bridge, on the summit of which the coachman
  pulls up, and we see a deep cutting through the fields on our right,
  and a long and high embankment on the left. Scores of men, and horses
  drawing strange-looking vehicles, are hard at work, and we are told
  that this is to be the &quot;London and Birmingham Railway,&quot;
  which the coachman adds &quot;is going to drive <i>us</i> off the
  road.&quot; On we go again, through the noble avenue of trees near
  Dunchurch; through quaint and picturesque Coventry; past Meriden,
  where we see the words, &quot;Meriden School,&quot; built curiously,
  with vari-coloured bricks, into a boundary wall. On still; until at
  length the coachman, as the sun declines to the west, points out,
  amid a gloomy cloud in front of us, the dim outlines of the steeples
  and factory chimneys of Birmingham. On still; down the wide open
  roadway of Deritend; past the many-gabled &quot;Old Crown
  House;&quot; through the only really picturesque street in
  Birmingham&#8212;Digbeth; up the Bull Ring, the guard merrily
  trolling out upon his bugle, &quot;See the Conquering Hero
  Comes;&quot; round the corner into New Street where we pull
  up&#8212;the horses covered with foam&#8212;at the doors of &quot;The
  Swan.&quot; Our journey has taken us just twelve hours.</p>

  <p>And this is Birmingham! The place which I, in pleasant Kent and
  Surrey, had so often heard of, but had never seen. This is the town
  which, five years before, had vanquished the Conqueror of the Great
  Napoleon! This is the place which, for the first time in his life,
  had compelled the great Duke of Wellington to capitulate! This is the
  home of those who, headed by Attwood, had compelled the Duke and his
  army&#8212;the House of Lords&#8212;to submit, and to pass the
  memorable Reform Bill of 1832!</p>

  <p>My destination was at the top of Bull Street, where my apartments
  were ready, and a walk to that spot completed an eventful day for me.
  I had come down on a special business matter, but I remained six
  months, and a few years later came again and settled down in
  Birmingham. My impressions of the place during those six months are
  fresh upon my memory now; and, if I write them down, may be
  interesting to some of the three hundred thousand people now in
  Birmingham, who know nothing of its aspect then.</p>

  <p>Bull Street was then the principal street in Birmingham for retail
  business, and it contained some very excellent shops. Most of the
  then existing names have disappeared, but a few remain. Mr. Suffield,
  to whose courtesy I am indebted for the loan of the rare print from
  which the frontispiece to this little book is copied, then occupied
  the premises near the bottom of the street, which he still retains.
  Mr. Adkins, the druggist, carried on the business established almost
  a century ago. He is now the oldest inhabitant of Bull Street, having
  been born in the house he still occupies before the commencement of
  the present century. Mr. Gargory&#8212;still hale, vigorous, and
  hearty, although rapidly approaching his eightieth year&#8212;then
  tenanted the shop next below Mr. Keirle, the fishmonger. His present
  shop and that of Mr. Harris, the dyer, occupy the site of the then
  Quakers&#39; Meeting House, which was a long, barn-like building,
  standing lengthwise to the street, and not having a window on that
  side to break the dreary expanse of brickwork. Mr. Benson was in
  those days as celebrated for beef and civility as he is now. Mr. Page
  had just opened the shawl shop still carried on by his widow. Near
  the Coach Yard was the shop of Mr. Hudson, the bookseller, whose son
  still carries on the business established by his father in 1821. In
  1837, Mr. Hudson, Sen., was the publisher of a very well conducted
  liberal paper called <i>The Philanthropist</i>. The paper only
  existed some four or five years. It deserved a better fate. Next door
  to Mr. Hudson&#39;s was the shop of the father of the present Messrs.
  Southall. All these places have been materially altered, but the wine
  and spirit stores of Mrs. Peters, at the corner of Temple Row, are
  to-day, I think, exactly what they were forty years ago. The Brothers
  Cadbury&#8212;a name now celebrated all over the world&#8212;were
  then, as will be seen by reference to the frontispiece, shopkeepers
  in Bull Street, the one as a silk mercer, the other as a tea dealer.
  The latter commenced in Crooked Lane the manufacture of cocoa, in
  which business the name is still eminent. The Borough Bank at that
  time occupied the premises nearly opposite Union Passage, which are
  now used by Messrs. Smith as a carpet shop. In all other
  respects&#8212;except where the houses near the bottom are set back,
  and the widening of Temple Row&#8212;the street is little altered,
  except that nearly every shop has been newly fronted.</p>

  <p>High Street, from Bull Street to Carrs Lane, is a good deal
  altered. The Tamworth Banking Company occupied a lofty building
  nearly opposite the bottom of Bull Street, where for a very few years
  they carried on business, and the premises afterwards were occupied
  by Mrs. Syson, as a hosier&#39;s shop. The other buildings on both
  sides were small and insignificant, and they were mostly pulled down
  when the Great Western Railway Company tunneled under the street to
  make their line to Snow Hill. &quot;Taylor and Lloyd&#39;s&quot; Bank
  was then in Dale End. The passage running by the side of their
  premises is still called &quot;Bank Alley.&quot; Carrs Lane had a
  very narrow opening, and the Corn Exchange was not built. Most of the
  courts and passages in High Street were then filled with small
  dwelling houses, and the workshops of working bookbinders. Messrs.
  Westley Richards and Co. had their gun factory in one of them. The
  large pile of buildings built by Mr. Richards for Laing and Co., and
  now occupied by Messrs. Manton, the Bodega Company, and others, is
  the most important variation from the High Street of forty years ago.
  The narrow footpaths and contracted roadway were as inconveniently
  crowded as they are to-day. The house now occupied by Innes, Smith,
  and Co. was then a grocer&#39;s shop, and the inscription over the
  door was &quot;Dakin and Ridgway,&quot; two names which now, in
  London, are known to everybody as those of the most important retail
  tea dealers in the metropolis. Mr. Ridgway established the large
  concern in King William Street, and Mr. Dakin was the founder of
  &quot;No. 1, St. Paul&#39;s Churchyard.&quot;</p>

  <p>New Street is greatly altered. At that time it was not much more
  lively than Newhall Street is now. The Grammar School is just as it
  was; the Theatre, externally, is not much altered; &quot;The Hen and
  Chickens&quot; remains the same; the Town Hall, though not then
  finished, looked the same from New Street; and the portico of the
  Society of Artists&#39; rooms stood over the pavement then. With
  these exceptions I only know one more building that has not been
  pulled down, or so altered as to be unrecognisable. The exemption is
  the excrescence called Christ Church, which still disfigures the very
  finest site in the whole town.</p>

  <p>Hyam and Co. had removed from the opposite side of the street, and
  had just opened as a tailor&#39;s shop the queer old building known
  as the &quot;Pantechnetheca,&quot; and the ever-youthful Mr. Holliday
  was at &quot;Warwick House.&quot; The recollections of what the
  &quot;House&quot; was then makes me smile as I write. It had
  originally been two private houses. The one abutted upon the footway,
  and the other stood some thirty feet back, a pretty garden being in
  the front. The latter had been occupied by Mr. James Busby, who
  carried on the business of a wire-worker at the rear. The ground
  floor frontages of both had been taken out. A roof had been placed
  over the garden, two hideous small-framed bay windows fronted New
  Street, and a third faced what is now &quot;Warwick House
  Passage.&quot; The whole place had a curious
  &quot;pig-with-one-ear&quot; kind of aspect, the portion which had
  been the garden having no upper floors, while the other was three
  storeys high. The premises had been &quot;converted&quot; by a now
  long-forgotten association, called the &quot;Drapery Company,&quot;
  and as this had not been successful, Mr. Holliday and his then
  partner, Mr. Merrett, had become its successors. It was in 1839 that
  the first portion of the present palatial building was erected.</p>

  <p>A few doors from this was the office of <i>The Birmingham
  Journal</i>, a very different paper then from what it afterwards
  became. It had been originally started as a Tory paper by a few old
  &quot;fogies&quot; who used to meet at &quot;Joe Lindon&#39;s,&quot;
  &quot;The Minerva,&quot; in Peck Lane; and this was how it came
  about: <i>The Times</i> had, early in 1825, in a leader, held up to
  well-deserved ridicule some action on the part of the Birmingham Tory
  party. This gave awful and unpardonable offence, and retaliation was
  decided upon. Notes were sent to several frequenters of the room
  that, on a certain afternoon, important business would be
  &quot;on&quot; at Lindon&#39;s, and punctual attendance was
  requested. The room at the appointed time was full, and the table had
  been removed from the centre. The ordinarily clean-scrubbed floor was
  covered with sheet iron. A chairman was appointed; and one gentleman
  was requested to read the obnoxious article. This over, a well-fed,
  prosperous-looking, fox-hunting iron merchant from Great Charles
  Street rose, and in very shaky grammar moved, that <i>The Times</i>
  had disgraced itself and insulted Birmingham, and that it was the
  duty of every Birmingham man to stop its circulation in the town.
  This having been seconded, and duly carried, another rose and
  proposed that in order to mark the indignation of those present, the
  copy of the paper containing the offensive leader should be
  ignominiously burnt. This, too, was carried; whereupon the
  iron-dealer took up the doomed newspaper with a pair of tongs, placed
  it on the sheets of iron, and, taking a &quot;spill&quot; between the
  claws of the tongs, lighted it at the fire of the room, and ignited
  the ill-fated paper, which, amid the groans and hisses of the
  assembled patriots, burned to ashes. This ceremony being solemnly
  concluded, the &quot;business&quot; began. It was deplored that the
  &quot;loyal&quot; party was imperfectly represented in the town. It
  was considered desirable that the party should have an
  &quot;organ&quot; in the town; and it was decided to open a
  subscription there and then, to start one. The necessary capital was
  subscribed, and a committee was formed to arrange with Mr. William
  Hodgetts, a printer in Spiceal Street, for the production of the new
  paper. Mr. Hodgetts subscribed to the fund to the extent of £50, and
  the singularly inappropriate name for a <i>weekly</i> paper, <i>The
  Birmingham Journal</i>, was selected. The first number appeared June
  4th, 1825. The editor was Professor Bakewell. It continued in the
  same hands until June, 1827, when Mr. Hodgetts paid out the other
  partners, and became sole proprietor. He enlarged it in 1830, at
  which time it was edited by the well-remembered Jonathan Crowther. In
  1832 it was sold to the Liberal party. <i>The Argus</i>, in its issue
  for June, 1832, thus chronicles the fact:</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
    &quot;THE JOURNAL.&#8212;This newspaper is now the property of
    Parkes, Scholefield, and Redfern. It was purchased by Parkes in
    February last for the sum of two thousand pounds, and was delivered
    up to him on the 25th of March last. Poor Jonathan was
    unceremoniously turned out of the editorial snuggery into the
    miserable berth of the Editor&#39;s devil. &#39;Oh, what a falling
    off is here, my countrymen!&#39; And who, think ye, gentle readers,
    is now Editor of <i>The Journal</i>? An ex-pedagogue, one of the
    New Hall Hill martyrs, a &#39;talented&#39; writer that has been
    within the walls,&quot; &amp;c., &amp;c.
  </div>

  <p>This seems to point to George Edmonds; but I cannot find any other
  evidence that he was ever editor. Be that as it may, Crowther
  remained, and the paper was published at the old office in Spiceal
  Street as late as May, 1833, when it seems to have been removed to
  New Street, and placed under the care of Mr. Douglas. In May of that
  year, Mr. Hodgetts published the first number of <i>The Birmingham
  Advertiser</i>. Meanwhile, Mr. Douglas sat in <i>The Journal</i>
  office, in New Street. It was a little room, about 10 ft. by 6 ft.,
  and the approach was up three or four steps. Here he reigned supreme,
  concocted Radical leaders in bad taste and questionable English, and
  received advertisements and money. The whole thing was in wretched
  plight until about the year 1844, when&#8212;Mr. Michael Maher being
  editor&#8212;Mr. Feeney, who was connected with another paper in the
  town, went to London, saw Mr. Joseph Parkes, and arranged to purchase
  <i>The Journal</i>. Mr. Jaffray soon after came from Shrewsbury to
  assist in the management, and with care, industry, and perseverance,
  it soon grew to be one of the very best provincial papers in the
  country.</p>

  <p>The Post Office occupied the site now covered by Lilly and
  Addinsell&#39;s shop. The New Street frontage was the dwelling house
  of Mr. Gottwaltz, the post-master. A little way up Bennetts Hill was
  a semicircular cove, or recess, in which two people might stand. Here
  was a slit, into which letters were dropped, and an
  &quot;inquiry&quot; window; and this was all. There were seven other
  receiving houses in the town, which were as follows: Mr. Hewitt,
  Hagley Row; Mr. E. Gunn, 1, Kenion Street; Mr. W. Drury, 30,
  Lancaster Street; Mr. Ash, Prospect Row; Mr. White, 235, Bristol
  Street; Miss Davis, Sand Pits; and Mrs. Wood, 172, High Street,
  Deritend. Two deliveries took place daily&#8212;one at 8 a.m., the
  other at 5 p.m. The postage of a &quot;single&quot; letter to London
  then was ninepence; but a second piece of paper, however small, even
  the half of a bank note, made it a &quot;double&quot; letter, the
  postage of which was eighteenpence.</p>

  <p>Between Needless Alley and the house now occupied by Messrs. Reece
  and Harris, as offices, were three old-fashioned and rather dingy
  looking shops, of which I can tell a curious story. Rather more than
  twenty years ago, the late Mr. Samuel Haines acquired the lease of
  these three houses, which had a few years to run. The freehold
  belonged to the Grammar School. Mr. Haines proposed to Messrs.
  Whateley, the solicitors for the school, that the old lease should be
  cancelled; that they should grant him a fresh one at a greatly
  increased rental; and that he should pull down the old places and
  erect good and substantial houses on the site. This was agreed to;
  but when the details came to be settled, some dispute arose, and the
  negotiations were near going off. Mr. Haines, however, one day
  happened to go over the original lease&#8212;nearly a hundred years
  old&#8212;to see what the covenants were, and he found that he was
  bound to deliver up the plot of land in question to the school,
  somewhere, I think, about 1860 to 1865, &quot;well cropped with
  potatoes.&quot; This discovery removed the difficulty, the lease was
  granted, and the potato-garden is the site of the fine pile known as
  Brunswick Buildings, upon each house of which Mr. Haines&#39;s
  monogram, &quot;S.H.,&quot; appears in an ornamental scroll.</p>

  <p>The Town Hall had been opened three years. The Paradise Street
  front was finished, and the two sides were complete for about
  three-fourths of their length; but that portion where the double rows
  of columns stand, and the pediment fronting Ratcliff Place, had not
  been built. The whole of that end was then red brick. Prom the corner
  of Edmund Street a row of beggarly houses, standing on a bank some
  eight feet above the level of the road, reached to within a few yards
  of the hall itself, the space between them and the hall being
  enclosed by a high wall. On the other side, the houses in Paradise
  Street came to within about the same distance, and the intervening
  space was carefully enclosed. The interior of the hall was lighted by
  some elaborate bronzed brackets, projecting from the side, between
  the windows. They were modelled in imitation of vegetable forms; and
  at the ends, curving upwards, small branches stood in a group, like
  the fingers of a half-opened human hand. Each of these branchlets was
  a gas burner, which was covered by a semi-opaque glass globe, the
  intent being, evidently, to suggest a cluster of growing fruits. Some
  of the same pattern were placed in the Church of the Saviour when it
  was first opened, but they, as well as those at the Town Hall, were
  in a few years removed, greatly to the relief of many who thought
  them inexpressibly ugly.</p>

  <p>Nearly opposite the Town Hall was a lame attempt to convert an
  ugly chapel into a Grecian temple. It was a wretched architectural
  failure. It was &quot;The School of Medicine,&quot; and, as I know
  from a personal visit at the time, contained, even then, a very
  various and most extensive collection of anatomical preparations, and
  other matters connected with the noble profession to whose use it was
  dedicated. From the Town Hall to Easy Row the pathway was three or
  four feet higher than the road, and an ugly iron fence was there, to
  prevent passengers from tumbling over. On this elevated walk stood
  the offices of a celebrated character, &quot;Old&quot;&#8212;for I
  never heard him called by any other name&#8212;&quot;Old
  Spurrier,&quot; the hard, unbending, crafty lawyer, who, being
  permanently retained by the Mint to prosecute all coiners in the
  district, had a busy time of it, and gained for himself a large
  fortune and an evil reputation.</p>

  <p>Bennetts Hill was considered <i>the</i> street of the town,
  architecturally. The Norwich Union Office then held aloft the same
  lady, who, long neglected, looks now as if her eyes were bandaged to
  hide the tears which she is shedding over her broken scales. The Bank
  of England has not been altered, though at that time it was occupied
  by a private company. Where the Inland Revenue Offices now stand, was
  a stone barn, which was called a news-room. It was a desolate-looking
  place, inside and out, and it was a mercy when it was pulled down. At
  the right-hand corner, at the top, where Harrison&#39;s music shop
  now stands, there was, in a large open court-yard, a square old brick
  mansion, having a brick portico. A walled garden belonging to this
  house, ran down Bennetts Hill, nearly to Waterloo Street, and an old
  brick summer-house, which stood in the angle, was then occupied by
  Messrs. Whateley as offices, and afterwards by Mr. Nathaniel Lea, the
  sharebroker. At the corner of Temple Row West was a draper&#39;s
  shop, carried on by two brothers&#8212;William and John Boulton. The
  brothers fell out, and dissolved partnership. William took Mr. R.W.
  Gem&#39;s house and offices in New Street, and converted them into
  the shop now occupied by Messrs. Dew; stocked it; married a lady at
  Harborne; started off to Leamington on his wedding tour; was taken
  ill in the carriage on the way; was carried to bed at the hotel at
  Leamington, and died the same evening. His brother took to the New
  Street shop; closed the one in Temple Row; made his fortune; and died
  a few years ago&#8212;a bachelor&#8212;at Solihull.</p>

  <p>The present iron railings of St. Philip&#39;s Churchyard had not
  then been erected. There was a low fence, and pleasant avenues of
  trees skirted the fence on the sides next Colmore Row and Temple Row.
  I used to like to walk here in the quiet of evening, and I loved to
  listen to the bells in St. Philip&#39;s Church as they chimed out
  every three hours the merry air, &quot;Life let us Cherish.&quot;</p>

  <p>A few weeks before my arrival, a general election, consequent upon
  the dissolution of Parliament by the death of the King, took place.
  The Tory party in Birmingham had been indiscreet enough to contest
  the borough. They selected a very unlikely man to succeed&#8212;Mr.
  A.G. Stapleton&#8212;and they failed utterly, the Liberals polling
  more than two to one. The Conservatives had their head-quarters at
  the Royal Hotel in Temple Row. Crowds of excited people surrounded
  the hotel day by day and evening after evening. One night something
  unusual had exasperated them, and they attacked the hotel. There were
  no police in Birmingham then, and the mob had things pretty much
  their own way. Showers of heavy stones soon smashed the windows to
  atoms, and so damaged the building as to make it necessary to erect a
  scaffold covering the whole frontage before the necessary repairs
  could be completed. When I first saw it, it was in a wretched plight,
  and it took many weeks to repair the damage done by the rioters. The
  portico now standing in front of the building&#8212;which is now used
  as the Eye Hospital&#8212;was built at this time, the doorway up to
  then not having that protection.</p>

  <p>From this point, going towards Bull Street, the roadway suddenly
  narrowed to the same width as The Minories. Where the extensive
  warehouses of Messrs. Wilkinson and Riddell now stand, but projecting
  some twelve or fifteen feet beyond the present line of frontage, were
  the stables and yard of the hotel. On the spot where their busy
  clerks now pore over huge ledgers and journals, ostlers were then to
  be seen grooming horses, and accompanying their work with the
  peculiar hissing sound without which it appears that operation cannot
  be carried on. Mr. Small wood occupied the shop at the corner, and
  his parlour windows, on the ground floor, looked upon Bull Street,
  the window sills being gay with flowers. It was a very different shop
  to the splendid ones which has succeeded it, which Wilkinson and
  Riddell have just secured to add to their retail premises.</p>

  <p>The Old Square had, shortly before, been denuded of a pleasant
  garden in the centre, the roads up to that time having passed round,
  in front of the houses. The Workhouse stood on the left, about half
  way down Lichfield Street. It was a quaint pile of building, probably
  then about 150 years old. There was a large quadrangle, three sides
  of which were occupied by low two-storey buildings, and the fourth by
  a high brick wall next the street. This wall was pierced in the
  centre by an arch, within which hung a strong door, having an iron
  grating, through which the porter inside could inspect coming
  visitors. From this door a flagged footway crossed the quadrangle to
  the principal front, which was surmounted by an old-fashioned
  clock-turret. Although I was never an inmate of the establishment, I
  have reason to believe that other quadrangles and other buildings
  were in the rear. The portion vouchsafed to public inspection was
  mean in architectural style, and apparently very inadequate in size.
  From this point I do not remember anything worthy of note until Aston
  Park was reached, in the Aston Road. The park was then entire, and
  was completely enclosed by a high wall, similar in character to the
  portion remaining in the Witton Road which forms the boundary of the
  &quot;Lower Grounds.&quot; The Hall was occupied by the second James
  Watt, son of the great engineer. He had not much engineering skill,
  but was a man of considerable attainments, literary and
  philosophical. His huge frame might be seen two or three times a week
  in the shop of Mr. Wrightson, the bookseller, in New Street. He was
  on very intimate terms of friendship with Lord Brougham, who
  frequently visited him at Aston. The favourite seat of the two
  friends was in the temple-like summer-house, near the large pool in
  Mr. Quilter&#39;s pleasant grounds. The village of Aston was as
  country-like as if located twenty miles from a large town. Perry Barr
  was a <i>terra incognita</i> to most Birmingham people. Erdington,
  then universally called &quot;Yarnton,&quot; was little known, and
  Sutton Coldfield was a far-off pleasant spot for pic-nics; but, to
  the bulk of Birmingham people, as much unknown as if it had been in
  the New Forest of Hampshire.</p>

  <p>Broad Street was skirted on both sides by private houses, each
  with its garden in front. Bingley House, where the Prince of Wales
  Theatre now stands, was occupied by Mr. Lloyd, the banker, and the
  fine trees of his park overhung the wall. None of the churches now
  standing in Broad Street were at that time built. The first shop
  opened at the Islington end of the street, was a draper&#39;s, just
  beyond Ryland Street. This was started by a man who travelled for Mr.
  Dakin, the grocer, and I remember he was thought to be mad for
  opening such a shop in so outlandish a place. The business is still
  carried on by Mr. D. Chapman. Rice Harris then lived in the house
  which is now the centre of the Children&#39;s Hospital, and the big
  ugly &quot;cones&quot; of his glass factory at the back belched forth
  continuous clouds of black smoke. Beyond the Five Ways there were no
  street lamps. The Hagley Road had a few houses dotted here and there,
  and had, at no distant time, been altered in direction, the line of
  road from near the present Francis Road to the Highfield Road having
  at one time curved very considerably to the left, as anyone may see
  by noticing the position of the frontage of the old houses on that
  side. All along the straightened part there was on the left a wide
  open ditch, filled, generally, with dirty water, across which brick
  arches carried roads to the private dwellings. &quot;The Plough and
  Harrow&quot; was an old-fashioned roadside public-house. Chad House,
  the present residence, I believe, of Mr. Hawkins, had been a
  public-house too, and a portion of the original building was
  preserved and incorporated with the new portion when the present
  house was built. Beyond this spot, with the exception of Hazelwood
  House, where the father of Rowland Hill, the postal reformer, kept
  his school, and some half-dozen red brick houses on the right, all
  was open country. Calthorpe Street was pretty well filled with
  buildings. St. George&#39;s Church was about half built. Frederick
  Street and George Street&#8212;for they were not &quot;Roads&quot;
  then&#8212;were being gradually filled up. There were some houses in
  the Church Road and at Wheeleys Hill, but the greater portion of
  Edgbaston was agricultural land.</p>

  <p>The south side of Ladywood Lane, being in Edgbaston parish, was
  pretty well built upon, owing to its being the nearest land to the
  centre of the town not burdened with town rating. There was a very
  large and lumbering old mansion on the left, near where Lench&#39;s
  Alms-houses now stand. Mr. R.W. Winfield lived at the red brick house
  between what are now the Francis and the Beaufort Roads. Nearly
  opposite his house was a carriage gateway opening upon an avenue of
  noble elms, at the end of which was Ladywood House, standing in a
  park. This, and the adjoining cottage, were the only houses upon the
  populous district now known as Ladywood. At the right-hand corner of
  the Reservoir &quot;Lane&quot; was the park and residence of Mr.
  William Chance. Further to the east, in Icknield Street, near the
  canal bridge&#8212;which at that time was an iron one, narrow and
  very dangerous&#8212;was another mansion and park, occupied by Mr.
  John Unett, Jun. This house is now occupied as a bedstead
  manufactory. Still further was another very large house, where Mr.
  Barker, the solicitor, lived. Further on again, the
  &quot;General&quot; Cemetery looked much the same as now, except that
  the trees were smaller, and there were not so many monuments.</p>

  <p>Soho Park, from Hockley Bridge, for about a mile on the road to
  West Bromwich, was entirely walled in. The old factory built by
  Boulton and Watt was still in operation. I saw there at work the
  original engine which was put up by James Watt. It had a massive oak
  beam, and it seemed strange to me that it did not communicate its
  power direct, but was employed in pumping water from the brook that
  flowed hard by, to a reservoir on higher ground. From this reservoir
  the water, as it descended, turned a water-wheel, which moved all the
  machinery in the place. It is not, perhaps, generally known that the
  same machine which was employed here in 1797 in making the old
  broad-rimmed copper pennies of George the Third is still at work at
  Messrs. Heaton&#39;s, coining the bronze money which has superseded
  the clumsy &quot;coppers&quot; of our forefathers.</p>

  <p>Coming towards the town, from Hockley Bridge to the corner of
  Livery Street, many of the houses had a pretty bit of garden in
  front, and the houses were mostly inhabited by jewellers. It was in
  this street that I first noticed a peculiarity in tradesmen&#39;s
  signboards, which then was general through the town, and had a very
  curious appearance to a stranger. Few of the occupiers&#39; names
  were painted on the <i>faci&aelig;</i> of the shop windows, but in almost
  every case a bordered wooden frame, following the outline of the
  window, was fixed above it. Each of these frames stood upon three or
  four wooden spheres, generally about the size of a cricket ball, and
  they were surmounted by wooden acorns or ornaments. The boards were
  all black, and the lettering invariably gilt, as were also the balls
  and the acorns. This, however strange, was not inconsistent; but
  there were hundreds of frames in the town stretched across the fronts
  of houses, and fixed to the walls by iron spikes. Every one of these
  signboards, although altogether unnecessary for its support, had
  three gilt balls underneath. There was another peculiarity: the
  capital letter C was invariably made with two
  &quot;serifs&quot;&#8212;thus, C&#8212;and for a long time I
  invariably read them as G&#39;s.</p>

  <p>Coming up Livery Street, which then was filled on both sides of
  its entire length by buildings, it was pointed out to me that the
  warehouse now occupied by Messrs. T. Barnes and Co. was built for a
  show-room and warehouse by Boulton and Watt, and here their smaller
  wares had been on view. Where Messrs. Billing&#39;s extensive
  buildings now stand, was an old chapel, built, I believe, by a
  congregation which ultimately removed to the large chapel in
  Steelhouse Lane. It was used as a place of worship until about 1848,
  when Mr. Billing bought it, pulled it down, and utilised its site for
  his business. The whole area of the Great Western Railway Station was
  then covered with buildings, and one, if not more, small streets ran
  through to Snow Hill. Monmouth Street was very narrow. Where the
  Arcade now is, was the Quakers&#39; burial ground. Opposite was the
  warehouse of Mr. Thornley, the druggist, who had a small and
  mean-looking shop at the corner, fronting Snow Hill. At the opposite
  corner was a shaky-looking stuccoed house, used as a draper&#39;s
  shop, the entrance being up three or four steps from Steelhouse
  Lane.</p>

  <p>Mr. George Richmond Collis had recently succeeded to the business,
  at the top of Church Street, of Sir Edward Thomason, who was dead. It
  was then <i>the</i> show manufactory of Birmingham. The
  buildings&#8212;pulled down seven or eight years ago&#8212;were at
  that time a smart-looking affair; the parapet was adorned with a
  number of large statues. Atlas was there, bending under the weight of
  two or three hundred pounds of Portland cement. Hercules brandished a
  heavy club, on which pigeons often settled. A copy of the celebrated
  group of the &quot;Horses of St. Mark&quot; was over the entrance.
  Several branches of Birmingham work were exhibited to visitors, and
  it was here I first saw stamping, cutting-out, press-work, and
  coining.</p>

  <p>There were then I think only ten churches in Birmingham. Bishop
  Ryder&#39;s was being built. The Rev. I.C. Barrett had just come from
  Hull to assume the incumbency of St. Mary&#39;s; the announcement of
  his presentation to the living appeared in <i>Aris&#39;s Gazette</i>,
  October 8th, 1837. I was one of his first hearers. The church had
  been comparatively deserted until he came, but it was soon filled to
  overflowing with an attentive congregation. There was an earnest tone
  and a poetical grace in his sermons which were fresh to Birmingham in
  those days. His voice was good, and his pale, thoughtful, intelligent
  face was very striking. He was a fascinating preacher, and he became
  the most popular minister in the town. The church was soon found to
  be too small for the crowds who wished to hear, and alterations of an
  extensive nature were made to give greater accommodation. Mr. Barrett
  had then the peculiarity in his manner of sounding certain vowels,
  which he still retains&#8212;always pronouncing the word
  &quot;turn,&quot; for instance, as if it were written
  &quot;tarn.&quot; I remember hearing him once preach from the text, 1
  <i>Cor</i>., iii., 23, which he announced as follows: &quot;The farst
  book of <i>Corinthians</i>, the thard chaptar, and the twenty-thard
  varse.&quot; Although still hale, active, and comparatively
  young-looking, he is by far the oldest incumbent in Birmingham,
  having held the living nearly forty years.</p>

  <p>St. George&#39;s Church then looked comparatively clean and new. A
  curious incident occurred here in May, 1833, an account of which I
  had from the lips of a son of the then churchwarden. Birmingham was
  visited by a very severe epidemic of influenza, which was so general
  that few households escaped. Nor was the epidemic confined to
  mankind; horses were attacked, and the proprietor of &quot;The Hen
  and Chickens&quot; lost by death sixteen horses in one day. So many
  of the clergy and ministers were ill, that some of the places of
  worship had to be closed for a time. St. George&#39;s, which had a
  rector and two curates, was kept open, although all its clergy were
  on the sick list. It was feared, however, that on one particular
  Sunday it would have to be closed. Application had been made to
  clergymen at a distance, but all, dreading infection, were afraid to
  come to the town, so that aid from outside could not be had. A
  consultation was held, and one of the curates, although weak and ill,
  undertook to conduct the devotional part of the service, but felt
  unable to preach. An announcement to be read by the &quot;clerk&quot;
  was written out by the rector, and was, no doubt, properly
  punctuated. At the close of the prayers, the next morning, the clerk
  arose, paper in hand, and proceeded to read as follows, without
  break, pause, or change of tone: &quot;I am desired to give notice
  that in consequence of the illness of the whole of the clergymen
  attached to this church there will be no sermon here this morning
  &#39;Praise God from whom all blessings flow.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>John Angell James was then at the head of the Nonconformists of
  the town, and was in the prime of his intellectual powers. He was
  very popular as a preacher, and the chapel in Carrs Lane was always
  well filled. Mr. Wm. Beaumont, the bank manager, acted as precentor,
  reading aloud the words of the hymns to be sung and the notices of
  coming religious events. Mr. James had a powerful voice and an
  impressive manner, and occasionally was very eloquent. I remember a
  passage, which struck me at the time as being very forcible. He was
  deprecating the influence which the works of Byron had upon the
  youthful mind, and, speaking of the poet, said: &quot;He wrote as
  with the pen of an archangel, dipped in the lava which issues from
  the bottomless pit.&quot; Mr. James was not a classical scholar;
  indeed, he had only received a very moderate amount of instruction.
  He was intended by his parents for a tradesman, and in fact was
  apprenticed to a draper at Poole. I believe, however, that the
  indentures were cancelled, for he became a preacher before he was
  twenty years of age. For myself, I always thought him an over-rated
  man. There was a narrowness of mind; there was a want of sympathy
  with the works of great poets and artists; and there was an intense
  hatred of the drama. There was, too, a dogmatic, egotistic manner,
  which led him always to enunciate his own thoughts as if they were
  absolutely true and incontrovertible. He was not a man to doubt or
  hesitate; he did not say &quot;It may be,&quot; or &quot;It is
  probable,&quot; but always &quot;It is.&quot; He was a good pastor,
  however. During his long and useful ministerial career of more than
  half a century, he had but one fold and one flock. He was a firm
  disciplinarian; was somewhat of a clerical martinet; but his people
  liked him, and were cheerfully obedient; and he descended to the
  grave full of abundant honour.</p>

  <p>Timothy East, of Steelhouse Lane Chapel, was a man of far greater
  mental capacity and culture. His sermons were clear, logical,
  conclusive, and earnest. It is not generally known that he was a
  voluminous writer. He was a frequent contributor to some of the best
  periodicals of his time. He wrote and published, under the titles,
  first of &quot;The Evangelical Rambler,&quot; and afterwards of
  &quot;The Evangelical Spectator,&quot; a series of exceedingly
  well-written essays, the style of which will compare favourably with
  that of the great standard works of a century before, whose titles he
  had appropriated. His son, the present Mr. Alfred Baldwin East,
  inherits a large share of his father&#39;s literary ability. Those
  who had the pleasure, a few years ago, to hear him read his
  manuscript of &quot;The Life and Times of Oliver Cromwell,&quot; had
  a rare intellectual treat. Some of its passages are worthy of
  Macaulay. I wish he would publish it.</p>

  <p>Of the newspapers of that time, only two survive, at least in
  name&#8212;<i>Aris&#39;s Gazette</i> and <i>The Midland Counties
  Herald</i>. The latter had just been started. For a short time it was
  called <i>The Birmingham Herald</i>, but this was soon altered to its
  present title. It was published on the premises now occupied as
  Nock&#39;s refreshment bar, in Union Passage. It had four pages then,
  as now, but the paper altogether was not much larger than the
  coloured cover of <i>The Graphic. The Journal</i>, although its name
  is lost, still lives and thrives as <i>The Weekly Post</i>. The two
  others are defunct long ago. One, <i>The Philanthropist</i>, was
  published in Bull Street by Mr. Hudson; the other was <i>The
  Birmingham Advertiser</i>, which, on the purchase of <i>The
  Journal</i> by the Liberals, had been started in 1833 by Mr.
  Hodgetts, in the Tory interest. It was edited by Mr. Thomas Ragg. It
  ceased to be published in 1846.</p>

  <p>The Grand Junction Railway, from Birmingham to Liverpool and
  Manchester, was opened July 4th, in the year I am writing of (1837),
  and on this line, in October of that year, I had my first railway
  trip. The &quot;Birmingham terminus&quot; of those days is now the
  goods station at Vauxhall, and it was here that I went to &quot;book
  my place&quot; for Wolverhampton. I entered a moderate-sized room,
  shabbily fitted with a few shelves and a deal counter, like a shop.
  Upon this counter, spread out, were a number of large open books, the
  pages of each being of different colour to the others. Each page
  contained a number of printed forms, with blank spaces to be filled
  up in writing. On applying to the clerk in attendance, I had to give
  my name and address, which he wrote in two places on the blue page of
  one of the books; he then took the money, tore out a ticket, some
  four inches by three, and left a counterpart in the book. I was then
  shown to my seat in the train, and on inspecting at my leisure the
  document I was favoured with, I found that in consideration of a sum
  of money therein mentioned, and in consideration further of my having
  impliedly undertaken to comply with certain rules and regulations,
  the company granted me a pass in a first-class carriage to
  Wolverhampton. I returned to Birmingham by omnibus after dark the
  same evening, and passing through the heart of the Black Country,
  made my first acquaintance with that dingy region&#8212;its lurid
  light, its flashing tongues of intercessant flame, and its clouds of
  stifling, sulphurous smoke.</p>

  <p>Such, rapidly sketched, were my impressions of the place which was
  destined to become my future home. It is very different now. From the
  large and populous, but ugly town of those days, it is rapidly
  becoming as handsome as any town in England. Situated as it is,
  locally, almost in the centre of the country, it is also a great
  centre commercially, artistically, politically, and intellectually.
  From the primitive town of that time, governed by constables and
  bailiffs, it has become a vast metropolis, and may fairly boast of
  having the most energetic, far-seeing, and intelligent Municipal
  Council in the kingdom. Its voice is listened to respectfully in the
  Senate. Its merchants are known and honoured in every country in the
  world. Its manufactured products are necessities to nearly every
  member of the vast human race; and it seems destined, at its present
  rate of progress, to become, before many years, the second city of
  the Empire.</p><a name="BULL" id="BULL"><!-- H2 anchor --></a>

  <h2>THE BULL RING RIOTS, 1839.</h2>

  <p>On Sunday, the 14th of July, in the year 1839, I left Euston
  Square by the night mail train. I had taken a ticket for Coventry,
  where I intended to commence a business journey of a month&#39;s
  duration. It was a hot and sultry night, and I was very glad when we
  arrived at Wolverton, where we had to wait ten minutes while the
  engine was changed. An enterprising person who owned a small plot of
  land adjoining the station, had erected thereon a small wooden hut,
  where, in winter time, he dispensed to shivering passengers hot
  elderberry wine and slips of toast, and in summer, tea, coffee, and
  genuine old-fashioned fermented ginger-beer. It was the only
  &quot;refreshment room&quot; upon the line, and people used to crowd
  his little shanty, clamouring loudly for supplies. He soon became the
  most popular man between London and Birmingham.</p>

  <p>Railway travelling then was in a very primitive condition. Except
  at the <i>termini</i> there were no platforms. Passengers had to
  clamber from the level of the rails by means of iron steps, to their
  seats. The roof of each of the coaches, as they were then called, was
  surrounded by an iron fence or parapet, to prevent luggage from
  slipping off. Each passenger&#39;s personal effects travelled on the
  roof of the coach in which he sat, and the guard occupied an outside
  seat at one end. First-class carriages were built upon the model of
  the &quot;inside&quot; of the old stage coaches. They were so low
  that even a short man could not stand upright. The seats were divided
  by arms, as now, and the floor was covered afresh for each journey
  with clean straw. The second-class coaches were simply execrable.
  They were roofed over, certainly; but, except a half-door and a low
  fencing, to prevent passengers from falling out, the sides were
  utterly unprotected from the weather. As the trains swept rapidly
  through the country&#8212;particularly in cuttings or on high
  embankments&#8212;the wind, even in the finest weather, drove
  through, &quot;enough to cut your ear off.&quot; When the weather was
  wet, or it was snowing, it was truly horrible, and, according to the
  testimony of medical men, was the primary cause of many deaths. There
  were no &quot;buffers&quot; to break the force of the concussion of
  two carriages in contact. When the train was about to start, the
  guard used to cry out along the train, &quot;Hold hard! we&#39;re
  going to start,&quot; and &#39;twas well he did, for sometimes, if
  unprepared, you might find your nose brought into collision with that
  of your opposite neighbour, accompanied by some painful sensations in
  that important part of your profile.</p>

  <p>I arrived at Coventry station at midnight. A solitary porter with
  a lantern was in attendance. There was no lamp about the place. The
  guard clambered to the roof of the carriage in which I had travelled,
  and the porter brought a long board, having raised edges, down which
  my luggage came sliding to the ground. The train passed on, and I
  made inquiry for some vehicle to convey me to &quot;The Craven
  Arms,&quot; half a mile away. None were in attendance, nor was there
  any one who would carry my &quot;traps.&quot; I had about a
  hundred-weight of patterns, besides my portmanteau. I &quot;might
  leave my patterns in his room,&quot; the porter said, and I &quot;had
  better carry my &#39;things&#39; myself.&quot; There was no help for
  it, so, shouldering the portmanteau, I carried it up a narrow brick
  stair to the roadway. The &quot;station&quot; then consisted of the
  small house by the side of the bridge which crosses the railway, and
  the only means of entrance or exit to the line was by this steep
  stair, which was about three feet wide. The &quot;booking
  office&quot; was on the level of the road, by the side of the bridge,
  where Tennyson</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 10%;">
  &quot;Hung with grooms and porters,&quot;
</div>

  <p>while he</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 10%;">
  &quot;Waited for the train at Coventry.&quot;
</div>

  <p>Carrying a heavy portmanteau half a mile on a hot night, when you
  are tired, is not a pleasant job. When I arrived, hot and thirsty, at
  the inn, I looked upon the night porter as my best friend, when,
  after a little parley, he was able to get me a little something,
  &quot;out of a bottle o&#39; my own, you know, sir,&quot; with which
  I endeavoured, successfully, to repair the waste of tissue.</p>

  <p>The next day, having finished my work in Coventry, I started in a
  hired conveyance for Coleshill, and a pleasant drive of an hour and a
  half brought me to the door of &quot;The Swan&quot; in that quaint
  and quiet little town. The people of the house were very busy
  preparing for a public dinner that was to come off on the following
  day, and as the house was noisy, from the preparations, I took a
  quiet walk in the churchyard, little recking then, as I strolled in
  the solemn silence of the golden-tinted twilight, that, only ten
  miles from where I stood, at that moment, a crowd of furious men,
  with passions unbridled, and blood hot with diabolic hate, held at
  their mercy, undisturbed, the lives and property of the citizens of
  an important town; that several houses, fired by incendiary hands,
  were roaring like furnaces, and lighting with a lurid glare the
  overhanging sky; that women by hundreds were shrieking with terror,
  and brave men were standing aghast and appalled; that two of my own
  brothers and some valued friends were in deadly peril, and that one
  at that very instant was fighting for very life. It was the night of
  the great Bull Ring riots of 1839.</p>

  <p>When I arose the next morning I saw a man on horseback come
  rapidly to the house, his features wild with excitement, and his face
  pale with terror. His horse was covered with foam, and trembled
  violently. From the man&#39;s quivering lips I learned, by degrees,
  an incoherent story, which accounted for His strange demeanour. He
  was a servant at the inn, and had been to Birmingham that morning,
  early, to fetch from Mr. Keirle&#39;s shop, in Bull Street, a salmon
  for the coming dinner. On arriving at the town, he had been stopped
  at a barrier by some dragoons, who told him that he could go no
  further. Upon the poor fellow telling how urgent was his errand, and
  what a heavy blow it would be to society if the dinner at &quot;The
  Swan&quot; should be short of fish, he was allowed to pass, but was
  escorted by a dragoon, with drawn sword, to the shop. Here having
  obtained what he sought, he was duly marched back to the barrier and
  set at liberty, upon which he started off in mortal terror, and
  galloped all the way home, to tell us with tremulous tongue that
  Birmingham was all on fire, and that hundreds of people had been
  killed by the soldiers.</p>

  <p>A small group had gathered round him in the yard to listen to his
  incoherent, and, happily, exaggerated story. In a minute or two the
  landlady, who had in some remote part of the premises heard a word or
  two of the news the man had brought, came rushing out in a state of
  frantic terror, prepared evidently for the worst; but when she heard
  that James <i>had</i> brought the salmon, her face assumed an air of
  satisfaction, and with a pious &quot;Thank God! that&#39;s all
  right,&quot; she turned away; her mind tranquil, contented, and at
  perfect ease.</p>

  <p>After the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832, there was a
  political lull in England for a few years. The middle classes, being
  satisfied with the success they had achieved for themselves, did not
  trouble themselves very much for the extension of the franchise to
  the working classes. So long as trade remained good, and wages were
  easily earned, the masses remained quiet; but the disastrous panic of
  1837 altered the aspect of affairs. Trade was very much depressed. A
  series of bad harvests having occurred, and the Corn Laws not having
  been repealed, bread became dear, and so aggravated the sufferings of
  the people. Wages fell; manufactories in many places were entirely
  closed, and work became scarce. Naturally enough, the working men
  attributed their sufferings to their want of direct political
  influence, and began to clamour for the franchise. Feargus
  O&#39;Connor, a violent demagogue, fanned the flame, and the
  excitement became general. In the year 1838 some half-dozen Members
  of Parliament united with an equal number of working men in
  conference, and drew up a document, known afterwards as &quot;The
  People&#39;s Charter,&quot; which embodied what they considered the
  rightful demands of the working class. It had six distinct claims,
  which were called the &quot;points&quot; of the charter, and were as
  follows: 1. Universal suffrage. 2. Vote by ballot. 3. Equal electoral
  districts. 4. Annual Parliaments. 5. Abolition of property
  qualification for Members of Parliament. 6. Payment of Members. This
  programme, when promulgated, was enthusiastically received throughout
  the country, immense meetings being held in various places in its
  support. In Birmingham, meetings were held every Monday evening on
  Holloway Head, then an open space. On the 13th of August, 1838, there
  was a &quot;monster demonstration&quot; here, and it was computed
  that 100,000 persons were present. A petition in favour of the
  charter was adopted, and in a few days received nearly 95,000
  signatures. The former political leaders&#8212;G.F. Muntz, George
  Edmonds, and Clutton Salt&#8212;became all at once exceedingly
  unpopular, as they declined to join in the agitation. Torchlight
  meetings were held almost nightly in various parts of the country,
  and a Government proclamation was issued prohibiting them. Some of
  the leaders of the movement were arrested. There was evidently some
  central organisation at work, for a curious system of annoyance was
  simultaneously adopted. In all parts of the country the Chartists, in
  large and well-organised bodies, went, Sunday after Sunday, as soon
  as the doors were opened, and took possession of all the seats in the
  churches, thus shutting out the regular congregations. I was present
  at a proceeding of this kind at Cheltenham. I was staying at
  &quot;The Fleece,&quot; and on a Saturday evening was told by the
  landlord that if I wished to go to church the following morning, I
  had better be early, as the Chartists were expected there, and the
  hotel pew might be full. Dr. Close, the present Dean of Carlisle, was
  then the rector, and was a very popular preacher. I had long wished
  to hear him, and accordingly went to the church, with some other
  hotel guests. Soon after the bells had begun to chime, several
  hundreds of men filed in and took possession of every vacant seat and
  space. The aisles were so occupied that no one could pass, and there
  were probably not thirty of the regular worshippers there. There was
  not a female in the church. The men were very quiet, orderly, and
  well-behaved, and joined in the responses in a proper manner. The
  prayers over, Mr. Close ascended the pulpit, and took for a text, 1
  <i>Sam</i>. xii., 23: &quot;God forbid that I should sin against the
  Lord in ceasing to pray for you; but I will teach you the good and
  the right way.&quot; The eloquent rector was quite equal to the
  occasion; he gave them a thoroughly good dressing, and his extempore
  sermon lasted for two hours and a half! I watched, during the sermon,
  the impatient glances of some of the men; but they stayed the sermon
  out, and went away, hungrier certainly, if not wiser, than when they
  came.</p>

  <p>All through the winter of 1838 there was much excitement in the
  country. Many meetings were held, at which Feargus O&#39;Connor
  distinctly advised his hearers that they had a legitimate right to
  resort to force to obtain their demands. Birmingham, however,
  remained tolerably quiet until the beginning of April, 1839. On the
  1st of that month, and again on the 3rd, large meetings were held, at
  which Feargus O&#39;Connor, a Dr. John Taylor, &quot;delegates&quot;
  named Bassey, Donaldson, and Brown, made violent and inflammatory
  speeches. Meetings more or less numerously attended were held almost
  nightly. Upon the representation of the shopkeepers that their
  business was greatly hindered, the Mayor and magistrates, on the 10th
  of May, issued a notice forbidding the holding of the meetings. Of
  the twelve gentlemen whose signatures were attached to this notice,
  only two survive&#8212;Dr. Birt Davies and Mr. P.H. Muntz.</p>

  <p>On the 13th of May, a number of delegates from various parts of
  the country, calling themselves &quot;The National Convention,&quot;
  assembled in Birmingham. Their avowed object was to frighten
  Parliament into submission to their demands. They recommended a run
  for gold upon the savings banks, an entire abstinence from excisable
  articles, and universal cessation from work. Their proceedings at
  this conference added fuel to the fire, and the people became more
  audacious. Threats were now openly uttered nightly, and people began
  to be alarmed, particularly as it was rumoured that a general rising
  in the Black Country had been arranged for a certain day. Hundreds of
  pikes, it was said, were already forged, and specimens were freely
  exhibited of formidable weapons known to military men by the name of
  &quot;Caltrop&quot; or &quot;Calthorp,&quot; intended to impede the
  passage of cavalry. They consisted of four spikes of pointed iron,
  about four inches long, radiating from a common centre in such a
  manner that, however thrown, one spike would be uppermost. Like the
  three-legged symbol of the Isle of Man, their motto might be
  &quot;<i>Quoqunque jeceris stabit</i>.&quot; There was a perfect
  reign of terror, and people were afraid to venture out after
  nightfall. On Friday, the 29th of June, the Mayor, Mr. William
  Scholefield, met the mob, and in a short and friendly speech tried to
  induce them to disperse, promising them, if they would refrain from
  meeting in the streets, they should have the use of the Town Hall
  once a week for their meetings. This proposal was received with
  shouts of derision, and the mob, by this time greatly increased in
  numbers, marched noisily through New Street, Colmore Bow, Bull
  Street, and High Street, to the Bull Ring. On the following Monday,
  July 1st, there was a large crowd in the Bull Ring, where Mr. Feargus
  O&#39;Connor addressed them, and advised an adjournment to Gosta
  Green, to which place they accordingly marched, and O&#39;Connor made
  a violent speech. In the meantime the troops were ordered out, and a
  large body of pensioners, fully armed, were marched into the Bull
  Ring. Finding no one there, the Mayor ordered the troops back to the
  barracks, and the pensioners were dismissed. After the meeting at
  Gosta Green was over, the people marched with tremendous cheering
  back to the Bull Ring. They met again on Tuesday and Wednesday
  evenings, but no mischief, beyond a few broken windows, was done. On
  Thursday evening, about eight o&#39;clock, the mob was in great force
  in the accustomed spot, with flags, banners, and other insignia
  freely displayed. Suddenly, without a word of notice, a large body of
  London police, which had just arrived by train, came out of Moor
  Street and rushed directly at the mob. They were met by groans and
  threats, and a terrible fight at once commenced. The police with
  their staves fought their way to the standard bearers and demolished
  the flags; others laid on, right and left, with great fury. In a
  short time the Bull Ring was nearly cleared, but the people rallied,
  and, arming themselves with various improvised weapons, returned to
  the attack. The police were outnumbered, surrounded, and rendered
  powerless. Some were stoned, others knocked down and frightfully
  kicked; some were beaten badly about the head, and some were stabbed.
  No doubt many of them would have been killed, but just at this time
  Dr. Booth, a magistrate, arrived on the spot, accompanied by a troop
  of the 4th Dragoons, and a company of the Rifle Brigade. The Riot Act
  was read, and the military occupied the Bull Ring. The wounded police
  were rescued and carried to the Public Office, where Mr. Richards and
  some other surgeons were soon in attendance, and dressed their
  wounds. Seven had to be taken to the hospital. One was found to have
  been stabbed in the abdomen, and another in the groin, in a most
  dangerous manner. The troops, and such of the police as were able,
  continued to patrol the Bull Ring, and they succeeded in arresting
  about a dozen of the rioters, who were found to be armed with deadly
  weapons, and their pockets filled with large stones. The mob
  continued to increase until about eleven o&#39;clock, when they
  suddenly started off for Holloway Head, where they pulled down about
  twenty yards of the railing of St. Thomas&#39;s Church, arming
  themselves with the iron bars. They then proceeded to &quot;The
  Golden Lion,&quot; in Aston Street, where the &quot;convention&quot;
  held its meetings. Dr. Taylor addressed them, and upon his advice
  they separated and went home. Taylor was arrested at his lodgings the
  same night, and was brought before the magistrates about one
  o&#39;clock in the morning, when he was ordered to find bail, himself
  in £500, and two sureties of £250 each.</p>

  <p>On the following morning, by nine o&#39;clock, the rioters again
  met at Holloway Head. Mr. Alston, with a body of Dragoons,
  immediately went there, and the Riot Act was again read. The mob did
  not disperse; the soldiers charged them, and one fellow was felled to
  the ground by a sabre cut on the head from one of the soldiers.
  During the whole of this day the shops in High Street and the Bull
  King remained entirely closed. The magistrates and military patrolled
  the town, and were pelted with stones, but nothing very serious
  occurred, and for a few days afterwards the town was comparatively
  quiet.</p>

  <p>On Friday, the 12th of July, the House of Commons was asked by Mr.
  Thomas Attwood to take into consideration the prayer of a monster
  petition, which, on behalf of the Chartists, he had presented on June
  14th. This petition asked the House, in not very respectful terms, to
  pass an Act, whereby the six points of the Charter might become law.
  It was signed by 1,280,000 persons. A long debate ensued, and Mr.
  Attwood&#39;s proposition was negatived.</p>

  <p>When the news arrived, on Saturday, the Chartists were furious,
  and a large and noisy meeting was held at Holloway Head in the
  evening, but no active disturbance took place either on that or the
  following day.</p>

  <p>On Monday, the 15th, some of the leaders who had been arrested
  were brought before the magistrates at the Public Office. A Carlisle
  man, named Harvey, and two others named Lovett and Collins, were
  committed for trial by a very full Bench, there having been present
  the Mayor, Messrs. Thomas Clark, W. Chance, C. Shaw, P.H. Muntz, S.
  Beale, and J. Walker. The crowd, which had assembled in Moor Street
  and the Bull Ring, upon hearing the result, quietly dispersed, and
  for a few hours the town appeared to be in a perfectly tranquil
  condition. The soldiers retired to the barracks; the police remained
  at the Public Office, with instructions from the magistrates not to
  act without direct magisterial orders. The Mayor went to dinner, and
  the magistrates, without exception, left the Public Office, and went
  home.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this was only the lull before the coming storm, for
  that night was such as few can remember now without a shudder.</p>

  <p>About two hours after the magistrates had left the Public Office,
  the Bull Ring was very full, but nearly all who were there seemed
  present from motives of curiosity only. They were so orderly that no
  attempt was made to disperse them. The crowd became so dense that the
  shops were closed in apprehension that the windows might be
  accidentally broken by the pressure. About eight o&#39;clock,
  however, a cry was raised, and an organised gang, many hundreds in
  number, armed with bludgeons, bars of iron, and other formidable
  weapons, came marching up Digbeth. They turned down Moor Street, and
  without any parley, made an attack upon the Public Office,
  demolishing in a few seconds every window in the front of the
  building. There was a strong body of police inside, but they were
  powerless, for they had received definite orders not to interfere
  without fresh magisterial directions, and all the magistrates had
  left. The mob soon started back towards the Bull Ring, where they
  fell upon a respectable solicitor named Bond, who happened to be
  passing, and him they nearly killed. He was removed in an insensible
  and very dangerous condition to the George Hotel. Meanwhile, an
  attack was made with iron bars, used battering-ram fashion, upon the
  doors of many of the shops, the rioters &quot;prodding&quot; them
  with all their might. Messrs. Bourne&#39;s shop, at the corner of
  Moor Street, was the first to give way, and the men quickly gained
  admittance. A large number of loaves of sugar were piled near the
  windows, and these were passed rapidly into the street. There, being
  dashed violently to the ground, and broken to pieces, they formed
  dangerous missiles, with which the crowd soon demolished all the
  windows within reach. As the crowd of rioters increased, their
  weapons became too few, and the iron railings of St. Martin&#39;s
  Church were pulled down. With these very dangerous instruments they
  wrenched from Nelson&#39;s monument the massive bars of iron which
  surrounded it. These being long, and of great strength, proved to be
  formidable levers, with which to force doors and shutters. In a short
  time the entire area of the Bull Ring was filled with a mob of
  yelling demons, whose shouts and cries, mixed with the sounds of
  crashing timber, and the sharp rattle of breaking glass, made a
  hideous din. It was getting dark, and a cry was raised for a bonfire
  to give light. In a few moments the shop of Mr. Leggatt, an
  upholsterer, was broken open, and his stock of bedding, chairs,
  tables, and other valuable furniture was brought into the roadway,
  broken up, and fired, amid the cheers of the excited people. One man,
  more adventurous than the rest, deliberately carried a flaming brand
  into the shop and set the premises on fire. The sight of the flames
  seemed to rouse the mob to ungovernable fury. Snatching burning wood
  from the fire, they hurled it through the broken, windows in all
  directions. Rushing in to Bourne&#39;s shop, they rolled out tea
  canisters by dozens, which they emptied into the gutters, and then
  smashed to pieces. They then deliberately collected the shop paper
  around a pile of tea chests, and fired it, the shop soon filling with
  flames. The mob, now vastly increased in numbers, broke up into
  separate parties, one of which, with great violence, attacked the
  premises of Mr. Arnold, a pork butcher. He, however, with prudent
  forethought, had collected his workmen in the shop and armed them
  with heavy cleavers and other formidable implements of his trade, and
  so defended he kept the mob at bay, and eventually repulsed them. The
  shop of Mr. Martin, a jeweller, whose window was filled with watches,
  rings, and other costly articles, had its front completely battered
  in, and the valuable stock literally scattered in the road and
  scrambled for. Mr. Morris Banks, the druggist, had his stock of
  bottles of drugs smashed to atoms. A curious circumstance saved these
  premises from being set on fire. The mob had collected combustibles
  for the purpose, but in breaking indiscriminately the bottles in the
  shop, they had inadvertently smashed some containing a quantity of
  very powerful acids. These, escaping and mixing with other drugs,
  caused such a suffocating vapour that the miscreants were driven from
  the shop half choked. Other tradesmen whose places were badly damaged
  were Mr. Arthur Dakin, grocer; Mr. Savage, cheesemonger; Mrs.
  Brinton, pork butcher; Mr. Allen, baker; Mr. Heath, cheesemonger; Mr.
  Scudamore, druggist; and Mr. Horton, silversmith. Mr. Gooden, of the
  Nelson Hotel, which then stood upon the site of the present Fish
  Market, was a great sufferer, the whole of the windows of the hotel
  being smashed in, and some costly mirrors and other valuable
  furniture completely destroyed. The large premises of William Dakin
  and Co.&#8212;now occupied by Innes, Smith, and Co., but then a
  grocer&#39;s shop&#8212;were hotly besieged for nearly half an hour,
  but were, as will be fully described a little further on, most
  bravely and successfully defended. At nine o&#39;clock many of the
  shops were on fire, and heaps of combustibles from others were thrown
  upon the blazing pile in the streets. The shops were freely entered
  and robbed. Women and children were seen running away laden with
  costly goods of all kinds, and men urged each other on, shouting with
  fury until they were hoarse.</p>

  <p>The work of destruction went on undisturbed until nearly ten
  o&#39;clock, when suddenly, from the direction of High Street, a
  troop of Dragoons, with swords drawn, came at full gallop, and rushed
  into the crowd, slashing right and left with their sabres. They had
  been ordered to strike with the flats only, but some stones were
  thrown at them, after which some of the rioters got some very ugly
  cuts. Simultaneously the mob was taken in flank by a body of a
  hundred police, which came, headed by Mr. Joseph Walker and Mr.
  George Whateley, from Moor Street. Such of the mob as could get away
  fled in terror, but so many arrests were made that the prison in Moor
  Street was soon filled. In less than a quarter of an hour not one of
  the rioters was to be seen, and the peaceful inhabitants came
  trembling into the streets, to look upon the wreck, and to convey
  their women and children to some safer locality. Some ladies had to
  be brought from upper storeys by ladders. Tradesmen took their
  account books away, for fear of further troubles. The fire engines
  were brought, and vigorous help was soon obtained to work them. By
  one o&#39;clock in the morning the fires were all extinct, but at
  that time all that remained of the premises of Messrs. Bourne and Mr.
  Leggatt were the black and crumbling walls.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned the attack upon the premises of W. Dakin and Co.
  My own brother was manager there, and was in the very thick of the
  fray. From him at the time, I had a very graphic account of the
  affair, and in order that this little sketch might be as accurate as
  possible, I made a special visit to his house, nearly 150 miles from
  Birmingham, to refresh my memory; and the following account of the
  attack upon Dakin&#39;s, and the robbery at Horton&#39;s, is in his
  own language:</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
    <p>&quot;Remember it? Yes, I was confidential manager to Messrs. W.
    Dakin and Co., tea merchants, at No. 28, High Street, where they
    had large premises facing the street, and carried on a very
    extensive business, having about twenty assistants living on the
    premises.</p>

    <p>&quot;It was the custom every Monday evening to remove all the
    goods from the windows, so that the porters might clean the glass
    the following morning, and this had been done on the night of the
    riots, so that the windows were empty. There was a great crowd in
    the street that evening, and I ordered the place to be closed
    earlier than usual, and kept everybody on the alert. About eight
    o&#39;clock, amid increasing uproar in the street, there came a cry
    of &#39;Fire,&#39; and on proceeding to an upper floor I saw the
    glare of fire reflected in the windows of the opposite houses. I at
    once collected all the assistants and porters, and proceeding to
    the shop, we lighted the gas and mustered all the &#39;arms&#39; in
    the house. They consisted of an old sword and a horse pistol, the
    latter of which we loaded with ball. The front door was a very wide
    one, and here I planted one of the porters with a large kitchen
    poker. In one of the windows I placed a strong man with a crowbar,
    and in the other an active fellow with the sword. Presently we
    heard our upper windows smashing, and simultaneously, an attack was
    made upon our front door and windows by men armed with railings
    they had taken from Nelson&#39;s monument. These heavy bars were
    evidently wielded by men of great strength, for one of the earliest
    thrusts broke through a strong shutter, smashing a thick plate of
    glass inside. By holes through the bottom of the shutters, the men,
    using the bars as levers, wrenched the shutters out. There was a
    strong and very massive iron shutter-guarding bar about half-way
    up. They pulled at the shutters, jerking them against this bar
    until they broke them in two across the middle. They then pulled
    them away and smashed the whole front in, leaving us bare and
    completely open to the street. This did not take place, however,
    without a struggle, for as often as a hand or an arm came within
    reach, my doughty henchman with the sword chopped at them with
    great energy and considerable success. Others collected the metal
    weights of the shop and hurled them in the faces of our assailants.
    I, myself, knocked one fellow senseless by a blow from a four-pound
    weight, which I dashed full in his face. In return we were assailed
    by a perfect shower of miscellaneous missiles, including a great
    many large lumps of sugar, stolen from other grocers&#39; shops.
    Finding themselves baffled, a cry was raised of &#39;Fire the
    &#8212;&#8212; place&#39;. One of the men then deliberately climbed
    lamp-post opposite, and with one blow from a bar of iron knocked
    away the lamp and its connections, upon which the gas from the
    broken pipe flared up two or three feet high. From this flame they
    lighted a large number of combustibles, which they hurled amongst
    us and through the upper windows. I thought our time was come, but
    my men were very active, and we kept our ground. The young man with
    the pistol came to me and asked if he should fire.
    &#39;Certainly,&#39; said I, &#39;and mind you take good aim.&#39;
    He tried two or three times, but the thing wouldn&#39;t go off; we
    found afterwards that in his terror he had omitted to
    &#39;cock&#39; it. Spite of this disaster, we fought for about
    twenty minutes, when there came a sudden lull, and we were left
    alone. Looking cautiously through the broken window, I saw that the
    mob had complete possession of the shop of Mr. Horton, a
    silversmith, next door, and were appropriating the valuable
    contents. Men and women, laden with the spoil, were running off as
    fast as possible. The women were the worst, and they folded up
    their dresses like aprons, and carried off silver goods by
    laps-full.</p>

    <p>&quot;All at once there was a cry, a roar, and a sound of
    horses&#39; hoofs. A moment afterwards we saw a troop of Dragoons
    come tearing along, with swords drawn, slashing away on all sides.
    Some of the rioters were very badly cut, and the affrighted
    ruffians fled in all directions, amid groans, cries, curses, and a
    horrid turmoil. Several houses were on fire, and the whole place
    was lighted up with a lurid glow.</p>

    <p>&quot;Our premises inside presented a curious sight. Each floor
    was strewn with missiles thrown by the mob. Large lumps of sugar,
    stones, bits of iron, portions of bricks, pieces of coal, and
    embers of burning wood were mixed up with silver teapots, toast
    racks, glass cruets, and plated goods of every kind. Aloft in the
    gasalier we found a silver cruet stand and a bunch of three pounds
    of tallow candles. The whole place was in a frightful state of ruin
    and confusion. Our list of killed and wounded was, fortunately, a
    light one. I was the only one seriously hit. I had a heavy blow in
    the face which spoiled it as a picture, both in &#39;drawing&#39;
    and &#39;colour,&#39; for some time, but it eventually got well.
    One of our fellows, we found, had retired to his bed-room during
    the fight; he said he was &#39;demoralised.&#39; Another, a porter,
    had hidden himself in a place of great sweetness and
    safety&#8212;the dung-pit of the stable yard. Our premises,
    however, though damaged, were not destroyed, and our stock had not
    been stolen. We were warmly congratulated on the success of our
    defence, and &#39;Dakin&#39;s young men&#39; were looked upon as
    heroes for a time.&quot;</p>
  </div>

  <p>The magistrates, having been all summoned, remained in
  consultation at the Public Office during the whole night, and most
  energetic measures were determined upon. Barriers, guarded by
  soldiers, were placed at the entrances to all the streets leading to
  the centre of the town. It was resolved that no more than three
  persons should be allowed to collect at any point. To enforce these
  orders the whole of the special constables&#8212;2,000 in
  number&#8212;who were already sworn in, were called into active
  service. Arrangements were made to increase the number to 5,000.
  Messengers were sent to the authorities of the three adjoining
  counties, requesting the immediate assistance of the Yeomanry
  Cavalry. An &quot;eighteen-pounder&quot; piece of field artillery was
  placed on the summit of the hill in High Street, and another on
  Holloway Head. The suburbs of the town were to be patrolled
  continuously by the Dragoons, and the centre was to be under the
  protection of the special constables. A guard of the Rifle Brigade
  was to be stationed at the Public Office, and the remainder was to be
  kept in reserve for emergencies. The sittings of the magistrates were
  to be continuous day and night, and other precautionary measures were
  resolved upon.</p>

  <p>The town, the next morning, presented a most dismal appearance.
  The shops in all the principal streets were closed, and remained so
  during the day. Prom Moor Street to about a hundred yards beyond New
  Street there was scarcely a pane of glass left entire. Most of the
  doors and shutters were literally in splinters; valuable goods, in
  some of the shops from which the owners had fled in terror the night
  before, were lying in the smashed windows, entirely unprotected, and
  of the still smoking and steaming ruins of the premises of Messrs.
  Bourne and Mr. Leggatt nothing was left standing but the walls. The
  west side of the Bull Ring, from &quot;The Spread Eagle&quot; to New
  Street, was in a similar condition, but there had been no fires
  there. The whole area of the Bull Ring was strewn with a strange
  medley of miscellaneous items. Some one of the specials or police who
  had been on guard there during the night, in a spirit of grim humour,
  had stuck up a half-burnt arm-chair, in which they had placed, in
  imitation of a sitting figure, one of the large circular
  tea-canisters from Messrs. Bourne&#39;s, which, in its battered
  condition, bore some rough resemblance to a human form. They had
  clothed it with some half-burned bed ticking; had placed a shattered
  hat upon its summit; and, having made a small hole in that part which
  had been the neck, had stuck therein a long clay pipe. It had a very
  droll appearance. Feathers were flying about, and fragments of
  half-consumed furniture were jumbled up with smashed tea-chests and
  broken scales. The ground was black with tea, soaked by the water
  from the fire-engines. The railings of St. Martin&#39;s Church were
  in ruins, and Nelson&#39;s Statue was denuded of a great portion of
  its handsome iron fence. The whole place looked as though it had
  undergone a lengthened siege, and had been sacked by an infuriated
  soldiery.</p>

  <p>There is good reason for thinking that the riots were
  premeditated, and had been arranged by some mysterious, secret
  conclave in London or elsewhere. On this morning&#8212;the day
  <i>after</i> the riots, be it remembered&#8212;a letter was received
  by Messrs. Bourne, <i>bearing the London post-mark of the day
  before</i>, of which the following is a copy, in matter and in
  arrangement:</p>

  <center>
    <pre>
FAMINE, &amp;c.
The people shall rise like lions and shall not lie down till they
eat the prey, and drink the blood of the slain,
under
JESUS CHRIST!!
Taking vengeance upon all who disobey
THE GOSPEL!
ECCE, GLORIA DEI.          REX MUNDI.
EXEUNT OMNES.
 SELAH.
BLOOD.                      FIRE, &amp;c.
</pre>
  </center>

  <p>During the day preventive arrangements were actively put in
  practice. Captain Moorson, R.N., who was in command of the special
  constables, organised a system by which the several detachments into
  which he had divided them could be concentrated, at short notice,
  upon any given spot. Guardrooms were engaged at the principal inns,
  which were open day and night, and the specials were on duty for
  specified portions of each day. Each of the detachments had an
  officer to control their movements. Provisions of a simple nature
  were amply provided, and every arrangement was made for the comfort
  of the specials while on duty. In a day or two troops of Yeomanry
  marched in, and were quartered in the houses of the residents in the
  suburbs. Meanwhile, great indignation was openly expressed at what
  was thought the neglect of proper precaution on the part of the
  magistracy; and on Tuesday&#8212;the day after the fires&#8212;a
  meeting was held, at which the complaints were loudly and angrily
  discussed. A memorial was drawn up, numerously signed, and forwarded
  by the same night&#39;s post to Lord John Russell, who was then Home
  Secretary. It brought heavy charges of neglect against the local
  rulers, and finished as follows: &quot;Feeling that the Mayor and
  Magistrates have been guilty of gross dereliction of duty, we request
  your Lordship to institute proceedings to bring them to trial for
  their misconduct, and, in the meantime, to suspend them from any
  further control or interference.&quot;</p>

  <p>On the Wednesday morning, the London papers had long and special
  reports of Monday night&#39;s proceedings, and <i>The Times</i> gave
  publicity to two statements which I cannot find corroborated in any
  way. It stated that on Monday morning the town was placarded with an
  announcement that Mr. Thomas Attwood was expected in the town during
  the day, and would address the people; and it mentioned that about
  the middle of the day a man with a bell was sent round to announce
  that a meeting would be held upon Holloway Head at half-past six that
  evening, and that Mr. Attwood would be there. So far as I can
  discover by diligent search, neither of these statements was correct.
  They were, however, made the text of violent attacks, in the Press
  and in both Houses of Parliament, upon the magistrates, and upon Lord
  Melbourne&#39;s Ministry, which had appointed them. The virulence of
  these attacks was very remarkable even in those days, and was almost
  beyond what the present generation will believe possible. One of the
  speakers in the House of Lords did not hesitate to say that he held
  the &quot;Palace favourites&quot; liable to the country for having
  knowingly appointed violent demagogues and known disloyal persons to
  the magisterial bench. Lord Melbourne, in a long and eloquent speech,
  rebutted the charge, and read to the House a long and very able
  letter from Mr. William Scholefield, the Mayor, giving a full and
  fair history of the whole matter. Government, however, consented to
  institute a full inquiry; and Mr. Maule, the Solicitor to the
  Treasury, was sent down, and held sittings at the Hen and Chickens
  Hotel. His inquiries, however, were only preliminary to the full and
  exhaustive investigation made afterwards by Mr. Dundas, who, in his
  report to Parliament (presented October 26, 1840), fully absolved the
  Mayor and magistrates from blame.</p>

  <p>Upwards of sixty of the rioters having been apprehended, the
  magistrates had a busy week of it, and large numbers of prisoners
  were committed for trial. A Special Assize was opened at Warwick, on
  August 2nd, before Mr. Justice Littledale. Three men, named
  respectively, Howell, Roberts, and Jones, and a boy named Aston, were
  found guilty of arson, and condemned to death. The jury recommended
  them to mercy, but the judge told them, that as to the men, he could
  not support their appeal. The Town Council, however, petitioned for
  remission, and a separate petition of the inhabitants, the first
  signature to which was that of Messrs. Bourne, asked for mercy to the
  misguided convicts. They were ultimately transported for life. Of the
  many others who were found guilty, the majority were released upon
  their own recognisances, and others, to the number of about a dozen,
  were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment with hard labour.</p>

  <p>There remained the bill to be paid. Claims to the amount of
  £16,283 were sent in; and after a long and searching investigation of
  each claim separately, the sum of £15,027 was awarded to the
  sufferers. Rates to the amount of £20,000, for compensation, and to
  cover expenses, were, made in the Hundred of Hemlingford, and with
  the payment of these sums the Birmingham Riots of 1839 became matter
  of history only.</p>

  <p>It is a very extraordinary circumstance that to this time no one,
  so far as I am aware, has observed a remarkable coincidence. On the
  15th of July, 1791, the houses of Mr. John Ryland, at Easy Hill, Mr.
  John Taylor, Bordesley Hall, and William Hutton, the historian, in
  High Street, were destroyed by the &quot;Church and King&quot;
  rioters. On the 15th of July, in the year 1839, forty-eight years
  afterwards&#8212;to a day&#8212;the Chartist rioters were rampant in
  the Bull Ring.</p>

  <p>After 1839, the Birmingham Chartists gave very little trouble.
  There were occasional meetings sympathising with the movement, in
  other places, as at Newport in the following November, and in the
  Potteries in 1842. These meetings, however, were not largely
  attended, and there was none of the former excitement. On the 11th of
  April, 1848, the date of Feargus O&#39;Connor&#39;s wretched
  <i>fiasco</i> in London, they played their last feeble game. They
  held a meeting in the People&#39;s Hall, and I there heard some
  violent revolutionary speeches. There was, however, no response to
  their excited appeals, and from that day Chartism was practically
  extinct.</p>

  <p>It is not, perhaps, generally known that the principles embodied
  in the famous &quot;Charter&quot; were not new. In 1780 Charles James
  Fox, the great Whig leader, declared himself in favour of the
  identical six points which were, so long after, embodied in the
  programme of the Chartists. The Duke of Richmond of that time brought
  into the House of Lords, in the same year, a Bill to give universal
  suffrage and annual parliaments; and afterwards, Mr. Erskine, Sir
  James Macintosh, and Earl Grey advocated similar views.</p>

  <p>Several great causes were at work which tended to throw Chartism
  into obscurity. The repeal of the Corn Laws had given the people
  cheap bread, and the advent of free trade gave abundant work and good
  wages. With increased bodily comfort came contentment of mind. The
  greater freedom of intercourse, caused by railway travelling, showed
  the lower classes that the governing bodies were not so badly
  disposed towards them as they had been taught to believe. On the
  other hand, the upper classes acquired a higher sense of duty to
  their humbler neighbours. All grades came to understand each other
  better, and with increased knowledge came better feelings and a more
  friendly spirit.</p>

  <p>But another cause has perhaps had a deeper and more lasting
  effect. The abolition of the stamp duty upon newspapers, and the
  consequent advent of a cheap press, enabling every working man to see
  his daily paper, and to know what is going on, has carried into
  effect, silently, a revolution, complete and thorough, in English
  thought and manners, in relation to political matters. Every man now
  sees that, differing as Englishmen do, and always will, upon some
  matters, they all agree as to one object. That object is, &quot;the
  greatest good to the greatest number&quot; of their fellow
  countrymen. The pride of all Englishmen now, is in the glory that
  their great country has achieved in peaceful directions. Their ardent
  desire and prayer is, that the benefits they have secured for
  themselves in the last few and fruitful years of judicious
  legislation, may descend with ever-widening beneficent influences to
  succeeding generations.</p>

  <h2>GOSSIP ABOUT ROYALTY.</h2>

  <p>As I sit down to write, on the stormy evening of this twenty-ninth
  day of January, 1877, I bethink me that it is fifty-seven years
  to-day since death terminated a life and a reign alike unexampled for
  their length in the history of English monarchs. King George the
  Third died on the 29th of January, 1820.</p>

  <p>I remember the day perfectly. I, a child not quite five years old,
  was sitting with my parents in a room, the windows of which looked
  upon the street of a pleasant town in Kent. Snow was falling fast,
  and lay thick upon the ground outside. The weather was intensely
  cold, and we crowded round the fire for warmth and comfort. Suddenly
  there was a crash: a snowball fell in our midst, and the fragments of
  a windowpane were scattered in the room. My father rose in anger to
  go to catch the culprit who had thrown. He was unsuccessful; but in
  his short visit to the street he had learned some news, for when he
  returned he told us that the King was dead.</p>

  <p>The King dead? I had heard of &quot;the King&quot; of course, but
  what <i>it</i> was I had never thought of. To me it represented
  strength and omnipotent protection, but it was an abstraction only;
  an undefined something of awful portent; and that <i>it</i> could die
  was very mysterious, and set me wondering what we should do now.</p>

  <p>My father explained at once, that the King was only a man; that
  his sons and daughters, even, were old people now; that one of the
  sons died only a week ago, and wasn&#39;t buried yet; and that this
  son had left, fatherless, a little baby girl, not much over six
  months old, who, if she should live, might one day become the Queen
  of England. Such is my earliest recollection in connection with the
  illustrious lady who still, happily, sits upon the English
  throne.</p>

  <p>I am an old man now, but I remember that being without a King made
  me feel very uncomfortable then, particularly at night. A few days
  afterwards, however, there was a sound of trumpets in the street, and
  a number of elderly gentlemen, in very queer dresses and curious
  hats, stopped opposite our window, where one of them, standing upon a
  stool, read something from a paper. When he had finished, the
  trumpets sounded again, and I knew there was a new King, for all the
  people shouted, &quot;God save the King.&quot; Then, for the first
  time since the fatal day, I felt re-assured; and I went to bed that
  night free from the dread which had been instilled into my mind by a
  very judicious nurse, that Bonaparte might come in the dark; steal me
  and my little brother; and cook us for his Sunday dinner.</p>

  <p>Soon after this I had frequent opportunities of seeing a veritable
  Queen. The unfortunate Caroline, wife of George the Fourth, lived at
  Blackheath, and drove occasionally in an open carriage through the
  streets of Greenwich, and there I saw her. I have a perfect
  recollection of her face and figure. A very common-looking red face
  it was, and a very &quot;dowdy&quot; figure. She wore always an
  enormous flat-brimmed &quot;Leghorn&quot; hat, trimmed with ostrich
  feathers. The remainder of her dress was gaudy, and, if one may say
  so of a Queen&#39;s attire, rather vulgar. She was, however, very
  popular in the neighbourhood; and when, at her great trial, she was
  acquitted, the town of Greenwich was brilliantly illuminated. I
  remember, too, how she, having been snubbed at the coronation of her
  husband, died of grief only three weeks afterwards, and how in that
  very month of August, 1821, which saw her death, her illustrious
  spouse set forth, amid much pomp and gaiety, on a festive journey to
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>In October, 1822, I saw the King himself, on his way to embark at
  Greenwich, for Scotland. I remember a double line of soldiers along
  the road, several very fussy horsemen riding to and fro, a troop of
  Cavalry, and a carriage, in which sat a very fat elderly man, with a
  pale flabby face, without beard or whisker, but fringed with the
  curls of a large brown wig. That is all I remember, or care to
  remember, of George the Fourth.</p>

  <p>A little more than ten years after that cold January day of which
  I wrote, this King lay, dying, at Windsor. It was early summer, and
  I, a boy of fifteen, was one of a group of people who stood in front
  of a bookseller&#39;s shop at Guildford, reading a copy of a bulletin
  which had just arrived: &quot;<i>His Majesty has passed a restless
  night; the symptoms have not abated</i>.&quot; As I turned away, I
  overheard a woman say, &quot;The King&#39;ll be sure to die; he&#39;s
  got the symptoms, and I never knew anybody get over
  <i>that</i>.&quot; All at once the bells struck up a merry peal, and
  the Union Jack floated from the &quot;Upper Church&quot; tower. A
  crowd assembled round the &quot;White Hart,&quot; and a dozen
  post-horses, ready harnessed, stood waiting in the street. Presently
  there was a sound of hoofs and wheels, and three carriages dashed
  rapidly up the hill, to the front of the hotel. The people waved
  their hats and shouted. The glass window of one of the carriages was
  let down, and a child&#39;s face and uncovered head appeared in the
  opening: it was the Princess Victoria, then eleven years old. A mass
  of golden curls; a fair round face, with the full apple-shaped cheeks
  peculiar to the Guelphs; a pair of bright blue eyes; an upper lip too
  short to cover the front teeth; a pleasant smile; and a graceful
  bending of the tiny figure as the carriage passed away, left
  favourable impressions of the future Queen. She had been summoned
  from the Isle of Wight to be near her uncle; at whose death, a few
  days after&#8212;amid a storm of thunder and lightning, such as had
  not been known since the night when Cromwell died&#8212;his brother,
  the Duke of Clarence, was proclaimed King, and she became the Heiress
  Presumptive to the Crown of England.</p>

  <p>William the Fourth, with his good Queen, Adelaide, I saw once, as
  they rode in the great State carriage to the Handel commemoration, at
  Westminster Abbey, in June, 1834. The King had a good-tempered,
  simple-looking face, without much sign of intellectual power; the
  Queen&#39;s face was of Grecian shape, and had a thoughtful and
  intelligent expression. The face and features were good in form, but
  the complexion was highly coloured, and looked as though affected by
  some kind of inflammation. They were a quiet, unpretending,
  well-meaning, and moral couple. They purified the tainted precincts
  of the Court, and thus rendered it fit for the abode of the youthful
  and gracious lady who succeeded them.</p>

  <p>The next time I saw the Princess Victoria was in 1836. It was on a
  day which, but for the firmness of Sir John Conroy, who acted as
  Equerry, might have been her last. At any rate, but for him, she
  would have been in great peril. I was standing in the High Street of
  Rochester; a fearful hurricane was blowing from the west; chimney
  pots, tiles, and slates were flying in all directions, and the
  roaring of the wind, as it hurtled through the elms in the Deanery
  Garden, was loud as thunder. A strip of lead, two feet wide, the
  covering of a projecting shop window, rolled up like a ribbon, and
  fell into the street. At that moment three carriages, containing the
  Duchess of Kent, the Princess, and their suite, came by. They were on
  their way from Ramsgate to London, and a change of horses stood ready
  at the Bull Inn. Arriving there, a gentleman of the city approached
  Sir John, and advised him not to proceed further, telling him that if
  they attempted to cross Rochester bridge, the carriages might be
  upset by the force of the wind. The Royal travellers alighted, and
  Sir John proceeded to inspect the bridge. On his return, he advised
  the Duchess to stay, as the storm was raging fearfully, and the
  danger was imminent. The Princess, with characteristic courage,
  wanted to go on, but Sir John was firm, and he prevailed, for the
  journey onwards was postponed. In an hour from that time, nearly the
  whole of one parapet was lying in rains upon the footway of the
  bridge, and the other had been blown bodily into the river
  underneath. The Royal party had to stay all night, and the inn at
  which they slept, henceforth took the additional title of
  &quot;Victoria Hotel,&quot; which it still retains. The journey was
  resumed next day, the horses being carefully led by grooms over the
  roadway of the wall-less bridge.</p>

  <p>A few months after this, the Princess, at Kensington Palace, was
  called from her bed, in the twilight of a summer morning, and was
  greeted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Prime Minister, Lord
  Melbourne, as Queen of England. Her first act, as Queen, was to
  write, and despatch by a special messenger to Windsor, an
  affectionate letter to her widowed aunt, the Queen Dowager. From that
  time forward her daily doings have been duly chronicled, and need not
  be dwelt upon here; but a few sketches, incidental to her own and the
  Prince Consort&#39;s visits to Birmingham, will perhaps be
  interesting.</p>

  <p>When the Princess Victoria was a mere child, her excellent mother,
  in the course of a somewhat lengthy tour, brought her to Birmingham,
  to see some of the principal manufactories. Arrangements were made
  for their stay at Willday&#39;s Hotel, now the Eye Hospital, in
  Temple Row. On the day they were expected, a guard of honour,
  consisting of a company of Infantry, was in attendance, and, pending
  the Royal arrival, waited near the Rectory, in St. Philip&#39;s
  Churchyard. By a very singular chance, the officer then in command
  became, years after, the Rector of St. Philip&#39;s, and the occupier
  of the house before which he waited that day. He is now the Dean of
  Worcester, the Hon. and Rev. Grantham M. Yorke.</p>

  <p>As the hour of the arrival of the Royal visitors approached, the
  troops drew up in front of the hotel, and they presented arms as the
  carriage arrived. A great crowd had assembled. There were no police
  then, and order was badly kept. As the Princess alighted, a lady,
  standing near the door of the hotel (Mrs. Fairfax, who recently lived
  in Great Charles Street), moved by a sudden impulse, rushed forward,
  caught the Princess in her arms, and kissed her. The Duchess was
  annoyed, and the attendants, too, were very angry; but the crowd,
  recognising in the act only the &quot;one touch of nature&quot; that
  &quot;makes the whole world kin,&quot; gave the adventurous lady a
  round of hearty cheering.</p>

  <p>It was many years after her accession that the Queen revisited the
  town, but the Prince Consort came frequently. His first visit was in
  1843. Her Majesty and himself were the guests of Sir Robert Peel at
  Drayton Manor, and the Prince took the opportunity to come to
  Birmingham, to inspect some of the manufactories. There is reason to
  believe that the impressions he received that day were lasting, and
  that he ever afterwards took a very warm interest in the town and its
  various industries. Mr. Thomas Weston was Mayor at the time. He was a
  prosperous and very worthy man, possessing a large fund of common
  sense, but knowing little of courtly manners. Of course, as Chief
  Magistrate, he accompanied the Prince through the town, and joined
  him at the luncheon provided at the Grammar School, by the Rev. J.P.
  Lee, the Head Master. After luncheon, the Prince, his Equerry, and
  the Lord-Lieutenant, took their seats in the carriage, but the Mayor
  was missing. Anxious looks were exchanged, and as minute after minute
  went by, the attendants became impatient. The Prince stood up in the
  carriage, and put on an overcoat. Still the Mayor didn&#39;t come.
  At length it oozed out that he had lost his hat. A dozen hats were
  offered at once on loan; but the Mayor&#39;s head was a large one,
  and it was long before a hat sufficiently capacious could be found.
  It came at last, however, and the Mayor, in a borrowed hat, came
  rushing out, much disconcerted, and full, evidently, of apologies,
  which the Prince, with much good nature, laughingly accepted.</p>

  <p>The next time he came to Birmingham was in 1849. At this time the
  area from Broad Street to Cambridge Street in one direction, and in
  the other from King Edward&#39;s to King Alfred&#39;s Place, now
  covered with buildings, was enclosed on all sides by a brick wall
  some ten feet high. Inside this wall there was a belt of trees all
  round, and a few &quot;ancestral elms&quot; were dotted here and
  there within the enclosure. About a hundred yards from the Broad
  Street wall stood a square house of red brick, built in the style of
  architecture current in the days of Queen Anne. It was known as
  Bingley House. Not far from the spot where the house now occupied by
  Mr. Mann, the surgeon, stands, was a carriage gate, leading to the
  dwelling. The grounds were laid out in park-like fashion, and so late
  as 1847 were abundantly tenanted by wild rabbits. The house had been
  occupied for a generation or two by the Lloyd family, but about 1846
  or 1847 they removed, and it was understood that the ground was
  shortly to be devoted to building purposes.</p>

  <p>In 1848, an exhibition of Birmingham manufactures was projected:
  the idea, I believe, originating with the late Mr. Aitken. It was
  received with considerable favour, and a strong committee being
  formed, a plan was soon matured for carrying it into effect.
  Negotiations resulted in the tenancy, for the purpose, of Bingley
  House and grounds. Very soon a substantial timber building was seen
  rising within the wall, near the corner of King Alfred&#39;s Place.
  In a few weeks it was covered in; a broad corridor connected it with
  the old mansion; and early in 1849 an exhibition, most interesting in
  its details, and artistic in its arrangement, was opened. The larger
  articles were displayed in the temporary building; flat exhibits
  covered the walls of the corridor; and smaller matters were arranged,
  with great judgment, in the old-fashioned rooms of the house
  itself.</p>

  <p>The exhibition opened with great <i>éclat</i>. The buildings were
  thronged from morning till night with gratified crowds. Special
  reporters from the daily newspapers came down from London, and sent
  long and special reports for publication. The veteran magazine, now
  called <i>The Art Journal</i>, but then known as <i>The Art
  Union</i>, gave interesting accounts, with engravings of many of the
  articles on view, and the whole matter was a great and signal
  success.</p>

  <p>One morning the secretary received an intimation that Prince
  Albert was coming on the following day. Preparations on a suitable
  scale were at once commenced for his reception, and the principal
  exhibitors were invited to be in attendance. At the time appointed,
  the Prince, who had made a special journey from London for the
  purpose, was met by the officials at the entrance, and conducted
  systematically through the place. He made a most minute and careful
  examination of the whole of the contents, took copious memoranda, and
  chatted familiarly with everybody. One remark I heard him make struck
  me as significant of the practical, observant character of his mind.
  Cocoa-fibre matting was then comparatively unknown; the stone steps
  of the old hall had been carpeted with this new material; observing
  this, as he walked up the steps, the Prince turned to Mr. Aitken and
  said, &quot;Capital invention this; the only material I know of that
  wears better in a damp place than when dry.&quot;</p>

  <p>As he left the place on his return to London, he expressed, in
  cordial terms, his thanks for the attention shown him, and said he
  had &quot;been very much pleased; quite delighted, in fact,&quot; and
  so ended a visit which eventually led to the Great Exhibition of
  1851, the Royal Commission for the establishment of which was
  gazetted January 3, 1850.</p>

  <p>The Prince came again, to lay the foundation stone of the Midland
  Institute buildings. On that occasion he accepted an invitation to a
  public luncheon in the Town Hall, and it was here that he delivered
  the celebrated speech which placed him at once in the foremost rank
  of philosophic thinkers. He was much pleased at his cordial reception
  on this occasion, and it is known that it had much to do in
  overcoming the avowed reluctance of the Queen to visit Birmingham,
  and was mainly instrumental in inducing her to consent to open Aston
  Hall and Park.</p>

  <p>The 15th of June, 1858, was eagerly looked forward to, for on that
  day the Queen was coming. Taking a lesson from continental practice,
  it was wisely resolved that individual attempts at decoration should
  be discouraged, and that the inhabitants of each street should
  combine for effective artistic arrangements. For the first time, I
  believe, in England, Venetian masts were a principal feature, where
  possible. Poles by hundreds, and flags by thousands, were sought in
  all directions. The Town Hall was placed in the hands of skilful
  decorators. The interior was, as yet, a mystery; but the pediment
  fronting Paradise street was fitted with an enormous canvas-covered
  frame, upon which was emblazoned, in gorgeous, but proper heraldic
  style, the Royal Arms of England. All along the line of route through
  the town, and on the road to Aston, rose hundreds of galleries for
  spectators. Every one was busy in preparation, and nothing was
  omitted to make the scene as gay as possible.</p>

  <p>The morning of the day was fine and intensely hot. Each street had
  its own style of ornamentation, but the number of separate short
  lengths of the route, gave sufficient variety to avoid monotony. Bull
  Street, as seen from the bottom, seemed like a fairy scene from a
  theatre; all looked gay and pleasant to the artistic eye. The Town
  Hall had been transformed into a gorgeous Throne Room, and was
  crowded with the <i>élite</i> of the neighbourhood. The Queen, as
  usual, was punctual, and took her seat under a regal canopy. A short
  reception was held. The Mayor knelt, and rose up a Knight. The mover
  and seconder of the address from the Corporation kissed hands. Poor
  Alderman Horatio Cutler, in his confusion at finding himself in so
  august a presence, forgot the customary bending of the knee. In vain
  Lords in Waiting touched the back of his leg with their wands to
  remind him. He had lost his presence of mind, and retired in utter
  confusion, amid a general but suppressed titter.</p>

  <p>Then came the journey to the Park, through the long line of
  decorated streets; the short ceremony at the Hall, and the luncheon.
  Then the appearance in the gallery upon the roof of the glass
  pavilion, where the Queen and Prince received, and acknowledged
  gracefully, the plaudits of the spectators; and finally came the
  announcement by Sir Francis Scott, that he had received &quot;Her
  Majesty&#39;s gracious commands to declare, in her name, that the
  Park was now open.&quot;</p>

  <p>At the door of departure, her Majesty, in thanking the Mayor for
  the arrangements made for her comfort and convenience, was pleased to
  say that she had never before been greeted with such enthusiastic
  loyalty, and that the decorations had exceeded in beauty anything of
  the kind she had ever seen.</p>

  <p>I have never seen the Queen since. Her photographs, however, show
  me that, although she has twenty-seven grand-children, and has been
  Queen of England for more than forty years, she is still a comely
  matron, with every appearance of health and vigour. Long may she
  remain so! Long may she continue to be, as now, the kindly,
  sympathetic, motherly head of a contented, loyal, and united
  people.</p>

  <h2>BIRMINGHAM BANKS: OLD AND NEW.</h2>

  <p>At the close of the French war in 1814, the Bank of England
  commenced preparations for the return to specie payments. Immediate
  &quot;tightness&quot; in the money market was the result. Prices
  fell. Trade became dull. Credit was injured. The return of peace
  seemed, to the unthinking, a curse rather than a blessing. Alarming
  riots were frequent, and general distress and discontent existed. The
  Government, in some alarm, resolved to postpone the resumption of
  cash payments until 1819.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the subject of the proper regulation of the
  currency underwent a good deal of discussion, and in the year 1819
  the Act known as &quot;Peel&#39;s Bill&quot; was passed. It provided
  that after 1821 the bank should be compelled to pay its notes in
  bullion at the rate of £3 17s. 10-1/2d. per ounce, and that after
  1823 holders of notes might demand at the bank current coin of the
  realm in Exchange. The same Act abolished the legal tender of silver
  for any sum beyond forty shillings.</p>

  <p>This made matters worse. Banks became more stringent. Prices of
  all commodities fell. Numbers of people were thrown out of work.
  Poor&#39;s rates increased in amount and frequency, and general
  discontent prevailed. Corn and agricultural produce no longer fetched
  war prices. Landlords insisted upon retaining war rents, which
  farmers were unable to pay. To meet this difficulty, Parliament
  passed the Corn Laws, hoping thereby to keep up prices. These new
  laws produced the contrary effect. Wheat fell from 12s. to 5s. the
  bushel. Rents could not be collected. Mortgages upon land could not
  be redeemed, and land became practically unsaleable.</p>

  <p>Things at length attained such a condition, that Government became
  seriously alarmed, and brought into Parliament five distinct money
  bills in one night. These bills were hurried through both Houses as
  fast as the forms of Parliament would allow. All of them had for
  their object the relaxation of the stringency of the money laws; and
  one Act permitted the issue of one pound notes for ten years longer,
  <i>i.e.</i>, to 1833.</p>

  <p>Trade immediately revived. Labour became abundant, and everyone,
  high or low, in the country, felt immediate relief and benefit.
  Unfortunately, with the return to prosperity came the usual unwise
  rebound in public feeling. Everything became <i>couleur de rose</i>.
  The wildest joint stock enterprises were projected. Capital, obtained
  on easy terms of credit, was forced into every branch of commerce.
  Trade was pushed beyond legitimate requirements. Imports of cotton,
  wine, and silk increased so far beyond their usual amount, that the
  rates of exchange turned against this country. The Bank of England,
  in self-defence, &quot;put on the screw.&quot; Money invested in
  distant countries, in speculative operations, was now badly wanted at
  home. Suspicion arose, and confidence was shaken. Merchants, in
  default of their usual help from bankers, suspended payment. Bankers
  themselves, having depended upon the return of their former advances,
  were in great peril. Alarm having become general, there was a
  simultaneous run for gold throughout the country, with the result
  that in a very short time seventy-nine banks stopped payment, of
  which no fewer than fifty-nine became bankrupt. The whole kingdom was
  in a frightful state of consternation. Failure followed failure in
  rapid succession. The whole circulation of the country was deranged,
  and at the beginning of December, 1825, the Bank of England stock of
  cash amounted only to a very few thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>Ministers were called together in haste, and Cabinet Councils were
  daily held. It was decided to issue two millions sterling of
  Exchequer bills, upon which the bank was authorised to issue an equal
  amount of notes. The bank was also &quot;recommended&quot; to make
  advances of a further sum of three millions, upon the security of
  produce and general merchandise.</p>

  <p>At this moment a fortunate discovery was made which did more to
  allay the excitement than the measures just mentioned. The bank had
  ceased to issue one pound notes six years before, and it was thought
  that they had all been destroyed. Accidentally, and most opportunely,
  when things were at the worst, one of the <i>employés</i> of the
  Bank, in searching a store-room, found a case of the £1 unissued
  notes, which had escaped observation at the time of the destruction.
  They were at once issued to the public, by whom they were hailed with
  delight, as the first &quot;bit of blue&quot; in the monetary sky.
  Under these re-assuring circumstances the panic soon subsided, but it
  left its blighting legacy of misery, ruin, diminished credit, and
  general embarrassment.</p>

  <p>The banking laws were soon after altered. The Bank of England was
  induced to forego its exclusive monopoly of having more than six
  proprietors, and the formation of joint stock banks consequently
  became possible. A new era in banking commenced, which, modified from
  time to time, has existed down to the present time.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the close of the war, in 1814, was the
  commencement of the great and violent monetary changes I have
  attempted to describe. There were then six banks in Birmingham. Two
  of these are altogether extinct; the other four have merged into
  existing banks. For convenience sake, I will sketch the extinct banks
  first, and afterwards show the processes by which the others have
  been incorporated with existing institutions.</p>

  <p>At the period mentioned, the firm of Smith, Gray, Cooper, and Co.
  had the largest banking business in the town. They carried on their
  operations in the premises in Union Street now occupied by the
  Corporation as offices for their gas department. This bank did a
  large business with merchants and wholesale traders, and it &quot;was
  a very useful bank.&quot; After several changes, the firm became
  Gibbins, Smith, and Goode. In the great panic of 1825, one of their
  customers, a merchant named Wallace, failed, owing them £70,000.
  This, with other severe losses, brought them down. They failed for a
  very large amount. Such, however, had been their actual stability,
  that, after all their losses, and after payment of the costs of their
  bankruptcy, the creditors received a dividend of nineteen shillings
  and eightpence in the pound. Mr. Smith, of this firm, was a man of
  great shrewdness and probity, and was greatly esteemed by his
  friends. The late Mr. Thomas Upfill had, in his dining-room, an
  excellent life-size portrait of Mr. Smith, taken, probably, about the
  year 1820. This portrait is now in the possession of a lady at
  Harborne. The face is a shrewd and observant one, and it always
  struck me as having a remarkable likeness to the great James Watt,
  the engineer. Of Mr. Gibbins and Mr. Goode we shall hear more as we
  go on, but &quot;Smith&#39;s Bank&quot; became extinct.</p>

  <p>The firm of Galton, Galton, and James had their offices in the
  tall building in Steelhouse Lane, opposite the Children&#39;s
  Hospital. They weathered the storm of 1825, but, some years later on,
  Mr. James accepted the post of manager of the Birmingham Banking
  Company, whereupon the remaining partners retired into private life,
  and the bank was closed.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Freer, Rotton, Lloyds, and Co. had offices in New Street,
  now pulled down. They had a large number of customers, principally
  among the retail traders and the smaller manufacturers. The firm
  underwent several changes, being altered to Rotton, Onion, and Co.,
  then Rotton and Scholefield, and finally to Rotton and Son. The
  banking office, in the meantime, had been removed to the corner of
  Steelhouse Lane, in Bull Street. Upon the death of the elder Mr.
  Rotton, the business was transferred to the National Provincial Bank
  of England, Mr. Henry Rotton becoming manager. This gentleman, whose
  death only recently occurred, held this position for many years, and
  was universally respected. His mental organisation was, however, too
  refined and feminine to battle with the rough energy of modern
  trading. The bank, under his management, was tolerably successful,
  but it remained a small and somewhat insignificant concern in
  comparison with others. An arrangement, satisfactory on all sides,
  was at length entered into, under which he resigned his appointment.
  His successor is Mr. J.L. Porter, a man of different stamp. Under his
  sturdy and vigorous management the business has rapidly increased.
  The premises were soon found too small. They were, shortly after he
  came, pulled down, and the present magnificent banking house in
  Bennetts Hill was built upon the site of its somewhat ugly and
  badly-contrived predecessor.</p>

  <p>The firm of Coates, Woolley, and Gordon occupied, in 1815, the
  premises in Cherry Street now held by the Worcester City and County
  Bank. The business was, at a date I cannot learn, transferred to
  Moilliet, Smith, and Pearson, and this was subsequently changed to
  J.L. Moilliet and Sons, who carried the business on for many years,
  finally transferring it to Lloyds and Company Limited. This company
  removed it to their splendid branch establishment in Ann Street. Mr.
  Moilliet, the senior partner in the Cherry Street Bank, was a Swiss
  by birth, and lived in Newhall Street. In a warehouse at the back of
  his residence, he carried on the business of a continental merchant.
  The mercantile firm became afterwards Moilliet and Gem, who removed
  it to extensive premises in Charlotte Street. Here, under the firm of
  E. Gem and Co., it is still carried on.</p>

  <p>Taylor and Lloyd&#39;s Bank was established in 1765, at the corner
  of Bank Passage in Dale End. Mr. Taylor had been a very successful
  manufacturer of japanned goods, and made a very large number of
  snuff-boxes, then in universal use. He produced, among others, a
  style which was very popular, and the demand for which became
  enormous. They were of various colours and shapes, their peculiarity
  consisting entirely in the ornamentation of the surface. Each had a
  bright coloured ground, upon which was a very extraordinary wavy
  style of ornament of a different shade of colour, showing streaks and
  curves of the two colours alternately, in such an infinity of
  patterns, that it was said that no two were ever found alike. Other
  makers tried in vain to imitate them; &quot;how it was done&quot;
  became an important question. The mystery increased, when it became
  known that Mr. Taylor ornamented them all with his own hands, in a
  room to which no one else was admitted. The fortunate discoverer of
  the secret soon accumulated a large fortune, and he used to chuckle,
  years after, as he told that the process consisted in smearing the
  second coat of colour, while still wet, with the fleshy part of his
  thumb, which happened to have a peculiarly open or coarse
  &quot;grain.&quot; It will be seen at once that in this way he could
  produce an infinite variety. Mr. Lloyd, the other partner, belonged
  to a very old Welsh family, which, as landed proprietors, had been
  settled for generations near Llansantfraid, in Merionethshire. There
  are some very ancient monuments of the ancestors of this family in
  the parish church there.</p>

  <p>Somewhere about twenty-five years ago, the business was removed to
  the present premises in High Street, and a few years later on, the
  death&#8212;at Brighton&#8212;by his own hand, of Mr. Taylor, left
  the business entirely vested in the Lloyd family. About ten or twelve
  years ago it was decided to convert it into a limited liability
  company, and a very searching examination was made by public
  accountants, as a preliminary step. Just as the thing was ripe, the
  stoppage of the Birmingham Banking Company was announced. This
  deferred the project for a time, but the Messrs. Lloyd, with great
  judgment, published the accountants&#39; report. As soon as the
  excitement had abated, the prospectus was issued. The shares were
  eagerly subscribed for, and the company was formed. Moilliet&#39;s
  bank was included in the operation, and the bank, under the able
  presidency of Mr. Sampson Lloyd, commenced the energetic course of
  action which has resulted in its becoming the largest banking concern
  in the Midland Counties.</p>

  <p>I cannot at the moment ascertain the date of the formation of the
  firm of Attwood, Spooner, and Co., but in 1815 the partners appear to
  have been the three brothers&#8212;Thomas, Matthias, and George
  Attwood, and Mr. Richard Spooner. Matthias Attwood seceded, and went
  to London. Of Thomas, it is unnecessary to say one word to Birmingham
  people; his statue in our principal street shows that he was
  considered to be no common man. He was one of the first Members for
  Birmingham upon its incorporation, and was re-elected in 1837.
  Although he had been so great and successful as a popular political
  leader, he made no &quot;way&quot; in Parliament; and soon after the
  riots of 1839 he retired, being succeeded by Mr. George Frederick
  Muntz. The last time I saw Mr. Attwood was in 1849, at the exhibition
  in Bingley House. He was then a thin, wasted, and decrepit old man.
  It was about this time that he retired from the bank.</p>

  <p>George Attwood&#8212;his brother&#8212;was a man of different
  type. He was not a politician. He was, in his best days, energetic,
  prompt, and far-seeing. As he advanced in years he became fond of the
  pleasures of the table, and the quality of his port wine became
  proverbial. His intellect became dimmed, but his spirit of enterprise
  was active as ever. He speculated in mines and other property to a
  very large extent, and had not, as of old, the clear head to manage
  them properly. There is little reason to doubt that here lies the
  secret of the failure of the bank some years later.</p>

  <p>Richard Spooner was a remarkable man in many respects. Like many
  others who in their later years have become &quot;rank Tories,&quot;
  he began his political life as a Liberal, contesting the town of
  Stafford unsuccessfully in that interest. After the change in his
  views, he, upon the death of Mr. Joshua Scholefield, in July, 1844,
  was elected to be one of the Members for Birmingham, in opposition to
  the candidature of Mr. William Scholefield. At the general election
  in August, 1847, this decision was reversed; and Mr. Spooner, to this
  day, is remembered as having been the only Conservative Member
  Birmingham ever sent to Parliament.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spooner was afterwards chosen to represent North Warwickshire,
  a position he held until his death, at the great age of 85, in
  November, 1864. He was quite blind for some years before his death.
  He had a great horror of photographers, and refused all requests to
  sit for his portrait. One was at length obtained surreptitiously. On
  a fine summer day, he was persuaded, for the sake of the fresh air,
  to take a seat in the yard, which then existed at the back of the
  bank. Mr. Whitlock was in attendance, and succeeded, greatly to the
  delight of Mr. Spooner&#39;s friends, in obtaining a very good
  portrait of the blind old man, as he sat there, perfectly unconscious
  of what was going on. I believe this was the only portrait ever
  taken.</p>

  <p>At the death of Mr. George Attwood&#8212;which preceded that of
  Mr. Spooner by some years&#8212;the firm had been re-constituted, and
  became Attwood, Spooner, Marshalls, and Co. The partners in the new
  firm were Mr. Thomas Aurelius Attwood, Mr. R. Spooner, and Messrs.
  William and Henry Marshall, who had been clerks in the bank all their
  lives. The deaths, in a comparatively short period, of Mr. T.A.
  Attwood and Mr. W. Marshall, followed soon after by that of Mr.
  Spooner, left Mr. Henry Marshall the only surviving member of this
  firm.</p>

  <p>Soon after Mr. Spooner&#39;s death, it was announced that an
  amalgamation of this bank with the Birmingham Joint Stock Bank in
  Temple Row had been agreed upon, and satisfaction with this
  arrangement was universally expressed. On Saturday March 10,
  1865&#8212;only four months after Mr. Spooner&#39;s decease&#8212;the
  town, and in fact the whole country, was electrified by the
  announcement that the bank had stopped payment. People were
  incredulous, as it had been thought to be one of the safest banks in
  the kingdom. An excited crowd surrounded the bank premises during the
  whole day, and a strong force of police was in attendance to preserve
  order. In the course of the day a circular was issued, of which the
  following is a copy:</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
    &quot;It is with feelings of the deepest concern and distress that
    we announce that we are compelled to suspend payment, and this at
    the moment when, after several months of anxious negotiation, we
    had confidently trusted we should obtain such assistance as would
    enable us to carry into effect, on our part, the preliminary
    agreement for the amalgamation of the bank with the Birmingham
    Joint Stock Bank. In this hope we have been disappointed. Sums of
    money to a large amount were drawn out of the bank some years since
    by the family of the Attwoods. To this circumstance it can be
    clearly shown, at the proper time, our failure is to be attributed.
    For the last ten years every effort has been made to redeem the
    loss thus occasioned, but this has only been partially
    accomplished. The assets of the bank are, however, still very
    considerable, and there are real estates of great value belonging
    to the bank, and but slightly encumbered. We hope that in now
    suspending payment we shall be considered as taking the best and
    only step to ensure a just and equal distribution of our assets
    among our creditors.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Upon a full investigation of the state of affairs, it was found
  that the total amount of liabilities amounted to the large sum of
  £1,007,000, and that the assets consisted chiefly of landed and
  mining properties of a very speculative nature. There was also a very
  large amount of overdrawn balances due from customers. After many
  projects had been launched, it was announced that the committee of
  investigation had, subject to the approval of the general body of
  creditors, disposed of the entire assets to the directors of the
  Joint Stock Bank, they undertaking to pay the creditors of Attwood
  and Co., in immediate cash, a dividend of 11s. 3d. in the pound. This
  arrangement was carried into effect, and &quot;Attwood&#39;s
  Bank&quot; became a memory only. Mr. Henry Marshall is, however,
  still living in retirement at Weston-Super-Mare, and is,
  notwithstanding his great age, in vigorous health, both of mind and
  body.</p>

  <p>The old familiar premises have now, too, passed away. The
  inconvenient old office, with its rows of leather buckets, and its
  harmless array of antiquated blunderbuses; its old-fashioned desks,
  dark with age, and begrimed with ink spattered by successive
  generations of bygone clerks; the low ceiling and quaint elliptic
  arches; the little fire-place near the counter, where Aurelius
  Attwood, with his good-humoured face, used to stand warming his
  coat-tails, and greeting the customers as they came in, were all so
  much in harmony with the staid, gray-headed clerks, and the quiet,
  methodical ways of the place, that when there, one might fancy he had
  stepped back for fifty years, or was looking upon a picture by
  Hogarth.</p>

  <p>It was stated a few pages back that the Bank of England, after the
  great panic of 1825, consented to forego their exclusive privilege of
  joint-stock banking. This, however, was not done without an
  equivalent, for the Act of 1826, ratifying this consent, gave them
  the power of establishing branch banks in the large towns of England.
  In pursuance of the powers thus granted, the first branch was opened
  at Gloucester on July 19th of that year. Others were started at
  Manchester, September 21st, and Swansea, October 23rd. On New
  Year&#39;s Day, 1827, the Branch Bank of England commenced business
  in Birmingham, occupying the premises of the defunct firm of Gibbins,
  Smith, and Goode, in Union Street, now the Gas Offices of the
  Corporation. The first manager was Captain Nichols, who brought with
  him, from the parent bank, a staff of clerks. One of these, a mere
  youth at the time, was destined to fill an important position in the
  town and in the country. This was Charles Geach; a very remarkable
  man, of whom I shall have more to say by and by.</p>

  <p>Captain Nichols was succeeded by Captain Tindal, brother of the
  illustrious jurist, Lord Chief Justice Tindal. During this
  gentleman&#39;s tenure of office the business was removed to the
  premises in Bennetts Hill, vacated by the unfortunate &quot;Bank of
  Birmingham,&quot; of which more hereafter. Here the business has ever
  since been conducted.</p>

  <p>Captain Tindal was a good man of business, and under his
  management the bank was very prosperous. He was a man of
  highly-cultivated mind. He took a very active interest in all local
  matters connected with literature and art, and he was a very liberal
  patron of the drama. Those who had the pleasure of being present at
  the pleasant <i>soirées</i> at his house, to which he was accustomed
  to invite the literary and artistic notabilities of the
  neighbourhood, will not easily forget how pleasantly the evenings
  passed; how everyone enjoyed the charades and theatricals which were
  so excellently managed by the gifted Miss Keating, then a governess
  in the family; how, too, everyone was charmed with the original and
  convenient arrangement for supplying visitors with refreshments.
  Instead of the conventional &quot;sit-down suppers&quot; of those
  days, Captain Tindal had refreshment counters and occasional tables
  dotted here and there, so that his friends took what they pleased, at
  the time most convenient to themselves. One room was very popular.
  Within its hospitable portals, hungry bipeds of the male persuasion
  were supplied, to their intense satisfaction, with abundant oysters,
  and unlimited foaming Dublin stout. Oysters were then five shillings
  the barrel of ten dozens! <i>Tempora mutantur; spero meliora</i>!</p>

  <p>It was a great loss to social and artistic Birmingham when Captain
  Tindal was removed to London, twenty-one years ago. The Bank of
  England opened a &quot;West End&quot; branch in Burlington Gardens,
  London, and the Captain was appointed its first manager. This new
  branch was opened October 1st, 1856. The resolution of the Board of
  Directors to appoint Mr. Tindal to this position seems to have been
  taken suddenly, for Mr. Chippindale, who had been sub-manager for
  some years, and was now placed at the head of the Birmingham branch,
  did not know of it until he was informed of his appointment by a
  customer of the bank. This gentleman, who was a merchant in the town,
  tells me that he &quot;was the first to tell him of it. He said it
  was not true, and he must go out and contradict it. I told him I
  <i>knew</i> it <i>was</i> true, but even then he was
  incredulous.&quot; Mr. Chippindale has recently retired, and has been
  succeeded by Mr. F.F. Barham.</p>

  <p>Soon after Mr. Chippindale&#39;s appointment, a friend of mine
  received from New York a large sum in four months&#39; bills upon
  Glasgow, which he wished to discount. He was well known in
  Birmingham, but had no regular banking account. The bank rate in
  London was four per cent. He took the bills first to the National
  Provincial Bank, where Mr. Henry Rotton offered to &quot;do&quot;
  them at four-and-a-half. This he thought too high, and he next took
  them to the Bank of England. Mr. Chippindale told him that the rule
  of the bank was not to discount anything having more than ninety days
  to run; but, if he left the bills as security, he could draw against
  them for the cash he wanted, and, as soon as the bills came within
  the ninety days&#39; limit, they could be discounted at the London
  rate of the day. This arrangement was entered into, but,
  unfortunately for my friend, a sudden turn in the market sent the
  rate up three per cent. within the month, so that, when the
  transaction was completed, he had to pay seven per cent. It made a
  difference to him of between £200 and £300.</p>

  <p>From the time of Mr. Chippindale&#39;s appointment, the branch
  bank has gone quietly on in its useful course. It does not compete
  much with the other banks in general business; indeed, its office
  seems to be rather that of a bank for bankers. Now that none of the
  local banks issue their own notes, it is a great convenience to them
  to have on the spot a store of Bank of England paper, available at a
  moment&#39;s notice, to any required amount.</p>

  <p>The ten years from 1826 were very fruitful of joint stock banks in
  Birmingham. Some have survived, but many are almost forgotten. I will
  mention the defunct ones first. The &quot;Bank of Birmingham&quot;
  was promoted by a Quaker gentleman, named Pearson. He had been, I
  believe, a merchant in the town, but was afterwards a partner in the
  firm of Moilliet Smith, and Pearson, from which he seems to have
  retired at, the same time as his partner, the well-known Mr. Timothy
  Smith. The Bank of Birmingham started with high aims and lofty
  expectations. The directors built for their offices the substantial
  edifice on Bennetts Hill, now occupied as the Branch Bank of England,
  and they prepared for a very large business. They, however, much as
  they may have been respected, and successful as most of them
  undoubtedly were in their private affairs, were not men of large
  capacity, and they had not the quick and sound judgment of character
  and circumstances necessary in banking. Nor were they very fortunate
  in their manager. Mr. Pearson, although he might have been taken as a
  model of honesty, truthfulness, and straightforwardness, was a
  phlegmatic, heavy man, and his manners were, to say the least,
  unprepossessing. The bank was not a success. Negotiations were, a few
  years after, entered into, and arrangements resulted, by which the
  Birmingham Banking Company took over the business, on the basis of
  giving every shareholder in the Bank of Birmingham a certain reduced
  amount of stock in their own bank, in exchange.</p>

  <p>Some time before the transfer took place, a member of one of the
  most respected and influential mercantile families in the
  neighbourhood suspended payment, owing a large sum to the Bank of
  Birmingham, upon which he paid a composition. He afterwards
  prospered, and some twenty-five years afterwards, all those
  shareholders in the defunct bank who still held, in the Birmingham
  Banking Company, the shares they had been allotted in exchange at the
  time of the transfer, received cheques for the deficiency, with
  interest thereon for the whole period it had been unpaid. A relative
  of my own received, in this way, several hundred pounds. I am not
  aware that this circumstance has ever been made public, but it is due
  to the memory of the late Mr. Robert Lucas Chance that so
  praise-worthy an act should be on record.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pearson, after the closing of the bank, commenced business as
  a sharebroker, which he continued until his death. He was one of the
  last to retain, in all its rigour, the peculiar dress of the Society
  of Friends. His stout, broad-set figure, with the wide-brimmed hat,
  collarless coat, drab &quot;thoses&quot; and gaiters, will be
  remembered by many readers.</p>

  <p>The Commercial Bank had offices at the corner of Ann Street and
  Bennetts Hill. Mr. John Stubbs was an active promoter of this bank,
  and Mr. James Graham was manager. It had a short life. Mr. Graham
  went to America, and died somewhere on the banks of the
  Mississippi.</p>

  <p>The Tamworth Banking Company opened a branch in High Street,
  opposite the bottom of Bull Street. It was open as late as 1838, but
  was eventually given up, and the premises were occupied by Mrs. Syson
  as a hosier&#39;s shop, until pulled down for the Great Western
  Railway tunnel.</p>

  <p>The Borough Bank was promoted by Mr. Goode, of the defunct firm of
  Gibbins, Smith, and Goode. It was connected with the Northern and
  Central Bank of England. The office was in Bull Street, in the
  premises now held by Messrs. J. and B. Smith, Carpet Factors. This
  bank was unsuccessful, and when it closed, Mr. Goode opened a
  discounting office in the Upper Priory, which proved to be
  successful. After a few years, Mr. Goode took as partner his
  son-in-law, Mr. Marr, a Scotchman, who had been engaged in an Indian
  bank for many years. The firm then became Goode, Marr, and Co., under
  which designation it is still carried on. The present proprietor is
  the son of the Mr. Marr just named, and is the gentleman upon whom a
  violent murderous attack was made in his office a few years ago. Mr.
  Goode, the courteous manager of the Birmingham and Midland Bank, is
  the son of the founder of this firm.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that in 1825 the firm of Gibbins, Smith, and
  Co. collapsed. As soon as their affairs were arranged, Mr. Gibbins
  and a nephew of his, named Lovell, opened a bank in New Street, on
  the spot where Mr. Whitehead now has his shop, at the corner of
  Bennetts Hill. Here for some two or three years they appear to have
  done very well; in fact the business became too large for their
  capabilities. Some of the leading men of the town, with the return of
  prosperity, began to see that there was ample room for greater
  banking facilities than the then existing private banks could
  provide. Negotiations were accordingly entered into for the purchase
  of this business, and for its conversion into a joint stock bank.
  Terms were very soon provisionally settled, and the prospectus of the
  Birmingham Banking Company was issued. The capital was fixed at
  £500,000, in 10,000 shares of £50 each, of which £5 per share was to
  be immediately called up. The list of directors contained, among
  others, the names of Charles Shaw, William Chance, Frederic Ledsam,
  Joseph Gibbins, and John Mabson. The shares were readily taken by the
  public, and on September 1st, 1829, the company commenced operations
  on the premises of Gibbins and Lovell. It was decided, however, to
  build a suitable banking house, and in a very short time the building
  standing at the corner of Waterloo Street was erected. Before
  removing to the new bank, the directors made overtures to Mr. Paul
  Moon James, of the firm of Galton and Co., which resulted in that
  bank being closed, and Mr. James becoming manager of the Banking
  Company. With such directors, and with so able and so popular a man
  for the manager, the progress of the bank was very rapid, and it soon
  had the largest banking business in the town. In a few years the
  reputation which Mr. James had obtained as a successful banker
  induced the directors of a new bank at Manchester to make him a very
  lucrative offer. Much to the regret of his Birmingham directors, and
  indeed to the whole public of the town, he accepted the offer, and
  shortly afterwards removed to Manchester. He retained the position of
  manager there until his death. Mr. James was something more than a
  mere man of business. He had a cultured mind, and took a very active
  part in educational questions. This very day, on looking over an old
  book, I found his name as the Birmingham representative of a leading
  literary association of my younger days, the &quot;Society for the
  Diffusion of Useful Knowledge&quot;&#8212;a society which, with Lord
  Brougham for chairman and Charles Knight for its most active member,
  did much to create good, wholesome, cheap literature, and published,
  among many other works, the &quot;Penny Magazine&quot; and the
  &quot;Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia.&quot;</p>

  <p>After Mr. James left Birmingham, the directors of the Banking
  Company appointed Mr. William Beaumont to be his successor. A
  Yorkshireman by birth, he had resided for some time in Wolverhampton,
  filling a responsible position in one of the banks there. Mr.
  Beaumont remained manager of the Birmingham Banking Company until his
  death in 1863, having filled the office for more than a quarter of a
  century. During his life the bank had a very high reputation, and
  paid excellent dividends. It had squally weather occasionally, of
  coarse, but it weathered all storms. It was in great jeopardy in the
  great panic of 1837. It held at that time, drawn by one of its
  customers upon a Liverpool house, four bills for £20,000 each, and
  one for £10,000. It held besides heavy draughts upon the same firm by
  other houses, and the acceptors&#8212;failing remittances from
  America&#8212;were in great straits. Mr. Charles Shaw, the chairman
  of this bank, saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of
  the Bank of England, and averted the impending calamity. But for
  timely aid, the Liverpool firm must have stopped, to the ruin of half
  the country. The bank had another sharp turn of it from 1842 to 1844,
  when bar iron fell from £12 per ton to £6; but it overcame all its
  difficulties until the retirement of Mr. Shaw and the death of Mr.
  Beaumont.</p>

  <p>From this time forward there seems to have been great want of a
  strong head and a steady eye amongst the directors. The
  plausibilities of Mr. W.H. Beaumont&#8212;who had succeeded his
  father as manager&#8212;seem to have put them off their guard, and
  they followed where he led until it ended in ruin. It is useless now
  to say all one knows, or a quarter of what has been said; but it has
  always been my opinion, and always will be, that if Charles Shaw, or
  a man with half his courage and ability, had been at the helm, the
  Bank would not have closed its doors. Had they only sought counsel of
  their larger shareholders, there was amongst them one man, still
  living, who not only could, but would, have saved the bank from
  shipwreck.</p>

  <p>Few men in Birmingham are likely to forget &quot;Black
  Saturday,&quot; the 14th of July, 1866. Had a French army suddenly
  opened a bombardment of the town from Highgate, it would possibly not
  have caused greater astonishment and dismay. That very week shares
  had been sold on the Stock Exchange at a high premium; and now, by
  the culpable weakness of a few unquestionably honest and
  well-intentioned gentlemen, the hard-earned life&#39;s savings of
  aged and infirm men, the sole dependence of scores of widows and
  hundreds of orphans, was utterly gone. No wonder that pious,
  God-fearing men ground their teeth and muttered curses, or that
  women, pale and trembling, tore their hair in wild terror, while some
  poor sorrowing creatures sought refuge in suicide. No wonder that
  even now, more than eleven years after, the memory of that day still
  rises, like a hideous dream, in the minds of thousands.</p>

  <p>I have been shown a copy of a lithographed daily newspaper,
  printed on board the &quot;Great Eastern&quot; steamship, then
  engaged in laying the first successful Atlantic cable. In the number
  for July 14th, is an account of the stoppage of this bank, which had
  been telegraphed to the ship in mid-ocean by means of the cable then
  being submerged.</p>

  <p>Upon full investigation it was ascertained that the total
  liabilities amounted to £1,805,469 10s. 5d. All the capital was lost.
  A call of £10 per share was made upon the unfortunate shareholders,
  and the debts were paid. Some time afterwards the new
  &quot;limited&quot; company which had been formed upon the ruins of
  the defunct bank took over some unrealised assets, and this resulted
  in a return of £1 per share, leaving a clear total loss, taking the
  shares at the market price, of £43 per share.</p>

  <p>On Thursday, July 19th, a meeting of the shareholders was held in
  the large room at the Exchange, nearly 500 being present. Mr. Edwin
  Yates, the Mayor, presided, and in his opening remarks pointed out
  that the resuscitation of the bank was impossible, for various
  reasons which he mentioned. The discussion which followed was marked
  by great moderation. There was little excitement, and not much
  expression of angry feeling. Mr. William Holliday, in a very masterly
  speech of great length, showed the difficulties in the way of
  reviving the bank, and suggested that the only way of saving the
  property of the shareholders, was by the establishment of a new bank
  on the ruins of the old, the shareholders in which were to have
  priority in the allotment of shares. This, having, been discussed by
  several speakers, was eventually decided upon, and a committee was
  appointed to carry the resolutions into effect.</p>

  <p>The new bank, under the name of the &quot;Birmingham Banking
  Company Limited,&quot; was formed with all speed. Josiah
  Mason&#8212;then plain Mister&#8212;was the first chairman, and Mr.
  T.F. Shaw manager. The shares &quot;came out&quot; at a small
  premium, from which they gradually rose. From that time it has gone
  on steadily and surely. It has secured a good <i>clientèle</i>, and
  is doing a large and profitable, business. It pays good dividends,
  and its shares stand well in the market. Mr. Shaw retired, from
  &quot;continued ill health,&quot; in May, 1876. Mr. P.W. Walker was
  appointed manager <i>pro tem</i>., and at the end of the year, Mr.
  James Leigh, who had been manager of the Birmingham branch of the
  Worcester Bank, took the helm. May the bank under his guidance have,
  <i>fortitudine et prudentia</i>, a long career of prosperity and
  usefulness before it!</p>

  <p>I shall now have to go back again to the year 1836. At this time
  trade was good and everything looked prosperous. Mr. Geach, who was
  still a clerk in the Bank of England, conceived the idea of starting
  a fresh bank, and having secured the adhesion of a few influential
  men, the prospectus was issued of the Town and District Bank, capital
  £500,000, in 25,000 shares of £20 each. The shares were taken up
  readily, and the branch commenced business in Colmore Row, on the 1st
  of July, 1836. The directors were Messrs. George Bacchus (chairman),
  Edward Armfield, George J. Green, George C. Lingham, John G. Reeves,
  Josiah Richards, and Philip Williams.</p>

  <p>Although the bank had been started entirely through the exertions
  of Mr. Geach, who naturally expected to be appointed the manager, he
  was left out in the cold, and the appointment fell upon Mr. Bassett
  Smith. This gentleman had been a clerk to the firm of Gibbins, Smith,
  and Co., until their stoppage, and he afterwards was manager of a
  bank at Walsall, which appointment he threw up when he came to the
  District Bank. He held his position as manager here for many years,
  but was eventually induced to retire; He certainly was not a great
  banking genius. He was led more by impulse and feeling than by sound
  business judgment and coolness, and he often made mistakes in his
  estimate of the customers. Some&#8212;whom he liked&#8212;would
  &quot;get on&quot; easily enough, while others, equally worthy of
  attention, might ask in vain for slight accommodation. Nor was his
  manner judicious. I was in the bank one day, when a highly
  respectable man brought some bills to the counter to be placed to his
  account. The clerk took them to Mr. Smith, who was near the counter;
  he turned them over in his hand, and giving them back to the clerk,
  with a contemptuous gesture, said, loud enough to be heard by
  everyone there, &quot;No!&#8212;a thousand times no!&quot; Had the
  customer been a swindler he could not have been treated with greater
  insult and contumely. It was a fortunate thing for the bank when Mr.
  Barney became manager. From that time the bank has assumed its proper
  position. Under its new designation of the &quot;Birmingham and
  Dudley District Banking Company&quot; it has taken rapid strides.
  There is every reason now for thinking it is highly prosperous, and
  is likely to have a future of great use and profit. The new premises
  are an ornament to an ornamental part of the town, and are very
  conveniently arranged; but to people with weak eyes, the light from
  the windows, glaring in the face as one stands at the counter, is
  most unpleasant, and some steps to modify its effect might be
  judiciously taken.</p>

  <p>Immediately after Mr. Bassett Smith had been appointed manager of
  the District Bank, some gentlemen, amongst whom Mr. Gammon, of
  Belmont Row, was very prominent, thinking that in all fairness Mr.
  Geach should have been elected, seeing that he was the originator of
  the scheme, and had done the greater part of the preliminary work,
  determined to form another bank. There was to be no mistake this
  time, for Mr. Geach&#39;s name was inserted in the prospectus as the
  future manager. He was at this time only 28 years of age. He had been
  resident but a very few years in the town, but had already the
  reputation of being one of the most able young men in the place. His
  manners, too, were singularly agreeable. On the faith of his name,
  the public readily took up the necessary number of shares. So great
  was the energy employed, that in seven weeks from the opening of the
  District Bank, its competitor, the Birmingham and Midland Bank, had
  commenced business.</p>

  <p>Having been so long in the office of the Bank of England, in Union
  Street, the young manager naturally thought it the best locality for
  the new bank; and as there was a large shop vacant in that street, a
  few doors below Union Passage, on the right-hand side going down, it
  was taken, and in these temporary premises the bank commenced, on the
  23rd of August, 1836, its prosperous and most useful career.</p>

  <p>Mr. Robert Webb was the first Chairman of the Board of Directors;
  Mr. Thomas Bolton, merchant, of New Street, was one of the most
  active members. Mr. Samuel Beale, after a time, joined the board, and
  was very energetic. He soon formed a friendship for the manager which
  only terminated with life. Mr. Henry Edmunds, who so recently retired
  from the post of managing director, but who still holds a seat at the
  board, was sub-manager from the opening; and Mr. Goode, who now fills
  the manager&#39;s seat, went there as a clerk at the same time.</p>

  <p>The tact and energy of the manager, and the shrewd business
  capacity of the directors, soon secured a very large business. In a
  very short time the building now held by the Conservative Club, which
  the bank had erected a little higher up the street, was occupied, and
  here the business was conducted for more than twenty-five years. The
  building included a very commodious residence for the manager, and
  here Mr. Geach took up his abode with his family.</p>

  <p>During the preliminary disturbances in 1839, which culminated in
  the Bull Ring riots, Mr. Geach received private information one
  afternoon, which induced him to take extra precautions for the safety
  of the books, securities, and cash. While this was being done, the
  clerks had collected a number of men and some arms. They also
  obtained, and took to the roof, a great quantity of stones, bricks,
  and other missiles, which they stored behind the parapets. The men
  were so placed, that by mounting an inner stair they could ascend to
  the roof, from which spot, it was proposed, in case of attack, to
  hurl the missiles upon the mob below. News was soon brought that the
  mob was congregating in Dale End and that neighbourhood. At the
  request of some of the magistrates who were present, Mr. Geach
  started off for the barracks, galloping through the mob, who threw
  showers of stones, brick-ends, and other disagreeable missiles at
  him, and shouted, &quot;Stop him,&quot; &quot;Pull him off,&quot;
  &quot;He&#39;s going for the soldiers,&quot; and so on. His horse was
  a spirited one, and took him safely through. He reached the barracks
  and secured assistance. He then came back by another route to the
  bank, and the expected attack was averted. There is no doubt that his
  energetic conduct that day saved the town from violence and
  spoliation.</p>

  <p>It is not my intention in this paper to sketch the character of
  Mr. Geach. I have now only to deal with him in reference to the
  bank, which he so ably managed, and in which down to his death he
  felt the warmest interest. About 1839 or 1840 he began to engage in
  commercial transactions on his own account, and these growing upon
  him and requiring much of his personal attention, he, about 1846 or
  1847, resigned his position as manager, and was succeeded by his old
  friend and colleague, Mr. Henry Edmunds. Mr. Geach, however, though
  no longer engaged in the active management, was appointed managing
  director, and in this capacity was generally consulted on all the
  more important matters.</p>

  <p>Mr. Edmunds is a man of altogether different type to his
  predecessor. Mr. Geach had been bold in his management, to a degree
  which in less skilful hands might have been perilous to his
  employers. Mr. Edmunds&#39;s principal characteristic, as a manager,
  was excessive caution. But, although so utterly varying in character,
  both men were peculiarly fitted for their post at the time they were
  in power. Boldness and vigour gave the bank a large connection, and
  established an extensive business. Caution and carefulness were quite
  as essential in the times during which Mr. Edmunds guided the
  destinies of the bank. In that speculative period of twenty-five
  years, his prudence and cool judgment were valuable qualities, and
  they served good ends, for the &quot;Midland,&quot; under Mr.
  Edmunds, was pre-eminently a &quot;lucky&quot; bank. He had no
  occasion for the more brilliant qualities of his predecessor; the
  bank was offered more business than it cared for; and his caution and
  hesitation saved his directors much trouble, and his shareholders
  considerable loss.</p>

  <p>As in process of years the business increased, the old premises
  were found to be too small, and the directors contemplated
  enlargement. Some energetic spirits on the board advocated the
  erection of a new building. It was debated for some time, but it
  finally resulted in the erection of the present palatial banking
  house at the corner of Stephenson Place. It is no secret that Mr.
  Edmunds disapproved of the step, and, indeed, at the dinner given to
  celebrate the opening of the new premises, he expressed, in plain
  terms, his opinion that they had made a mistake, and that they had
  better have remained where they were.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, the business was removed to New Street in 1869,
  at which time, I believe, Mr. Samuel Buckley was Chairman of the
  Board of Directors. One can imagine the satisfactory feelings of his
  mind as he reflected that within a very few yards of the magnificent
  bank, of which he was then the head, he, comparatively unknown, took
  years before a situation in the warehouse of a merchant, Mr. Thomas
  Bolton, which then stood on the site of the Midland Hotel. In this
  business Mr. Buckley rapidly rose in the estimation of his employer,
  becoming, first his partner, and subsequently his successor. The
  business, when the old premises were required for other purposes, was
  removed first to Newhall Hill, and finally to Great Charles Street,
  where it is still carried on as Samuel Buckley and Co.</p>

  <p>Shortly before the removal to New Street, Mr. Edmunds began to
  wish for a less laborious position. Following the precedent in Mr.
  Geach&#39;s case, he was made managing director, and Mr. Goode took
  the well-earned position of manager. This arrangement existed until
  about twelve months ago, when Mr. Edmunds retired altogether from the
  active administration of the business. He retained, however, a seat
  at the board as one of the ordinary directors. On this occasion, the
  board, with the sanction of the shareholders, to mark their sense, of
  his admirable judgment and unceasing industry, voted him a retiring
  pension of £1,000 a year. His portrait now hangs in the board-room at
  the bank, near that of his friend, Mr. Geach. May the walls of this
  room, in the future, be adorned by the &quot;counterfeit
  presentment&quot; of successive managers as good and true as these
  two, the pioneers, have proved themselves!</p>

  <p>Mr. Goode&#39;s qualifications for the post he occupies are not
  only hereditary, but are supplemented by the experience of more than
  forty years in this bank, under the able guidance of the two
  colleagues who have preceded him. His acute perceptions and great
  financial skill qualify him admirably for the post, whilst his
  undeviating courtesy has made him very popular, and has gained for
  him &quot;troops of friends.&quot;</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the enormous increase in the business of the town
  and neighbourhood, there was no other bank established in Birmingham
  for more than twenty-five years. One reason, probably, was that, by a
  clause in an Act of Parliament, it was made incumbent upon all banks
  established after it became law, to publish periodical statements of
  their affairs. This seemed to many shrewd men to be an obstacle to
  the success of any new bank, although it was felt that there was
  ample room for one. The passing of the Limited Liability Act opened
  the way. It was seen that by fixing the nominal capital very high,
  and calling up only a small portion of its amount, there would always
  be so large a margin of uncalled capital, that the periodical
  publication of assets and liabilities could alarm no one. Taking this
  view, and seeing the probability of a successful career for a new
  banking institution, a few far-seeing men&#8212;notably the late
  Messrs. John Graham and Henry Clive&#8212;soon attached to themselves
  a number of influential colleagues, and at the latter end of 1861 the
  prospectus of the Birmingham Joint Stock Bank was issued. Mr. G.F.
  Muntz was chairman, Mr. Thomas Short, vice-chairman, and Messrs. John
  Graham, H. Clive, R. Fletcher, J.S. Keep, W. Middlemore, C.H. Wagner,
  and W.A. Adams were directors. The capital, to the required extent,
  was eagerly subscribed. Mr. Joseph Beattie, of London, was appointed
  manager, and the bank opened its doors, in Temple Row West, on New
  Tear&#39;s Day, 1862.</p>

  <p>The directors, at their preliminary meetings, had come to some
  very wise resolutions, having for their tendency the creation of
  public confidence in the good management and complete stability of
  the new venture. One of these was that no one of the directors could
  at any time, or under any circumstances, overdraw his account at the
  bank. Recollections of what had been done aforetime showed the public
  the wisdom of this step, and the shares became consequently in good
  demand, and soon reached a fair premium. The directors, with great
  judgment, had made a large reserve of unallotted shares, and now that
  they had become a popular investment, they offered them to large
  traders at par, on condition of their opening accounts at the new
  bank. Other inducements were held out to attract business, and in a
  very short time the bank was doing at least as large a business as
  some of its competitors.</p>

  <p>The appointment of Mr. Beattie was a most judicious one. He is,
  unquestionably, a very able man of business; and his untiring energy
  and perseverance are very remarkable, even in these days of hard
  work. Under such management, and with so good a board of directors at
  his back, it is no wonder that the bank now occupies a foremost place
  amongst its fellows.</p>

  <p>The Worcester City and County Bank is the last, but it bids fairly
  to become by no means the least, amongst the banks of the town. The
  parent bank was established in Worcester in 1840. It was a prosperous
  and successful local bank of no great celebrity until the failure of
  Messrs. Farley and Co., of Kidderminster, in 1856. The directors then
  opened a branch establishment in that town, which was successful
  beyond expectation. Encouraged by this, they afterwards opened
  branches at Atherstone, Bridgnorth, Bromsgrove, Cheltenham,
  Droitwich, Evesham, Ludlow, Leominster, Presteign, Malvern, and
  Tenbury, and in 1872 they resolved to establish a bank at Birmingham.
  Lloyds and Co. had just removed from Moilliet&#39;s old premises in
  Cherry Street, to their new bank, in Ann Street, and, rather
  unwisely, left the old place in Cherry Street to be let to the first
  comer. The Worcester company became the tenants, and opened their
  bank in 1872, under the management of Mr. J.H. Slaney. This gentleman
  retired in about twelve months, and was succeeded by Mr. James Leigh,
  the present manager of the Birmingham Banking Company. When he
  accepted his present post, Mr. F.W. Nash took the helm. The bank
  seems, in the short time it has been established, to have been very
  successful, for the premises, after having been twice enlarged, are,
  it is said, now too small; and it is understood that a plot of land
  in Ann Street, near the corner of Newhall Street, has been secured,
  and that Mr. F.B. Osborne is engaged upon plans for the erection, on
  this site, of a new banking house, which will be no mean rival to
  those already in existence, adding another fine architectural
  structure to the splendid line of edifices which will soon be
  complete from the Town Hall to Snow Hill.</p>

  <p>There only remains one more bank to mention, and I cannot remember
  its name. It was opened some ten or twelve years ago in the tall
  building at the west corner of Warwick House Passage, now occupied by
  Mr. Hollingsworth. It was under the management of Mr. Edwin Wignall,
  who had been sub-manager at the District. It had but a short life.
  The careful manner in which the stone pavement of the vestibule and
  the steps leading from the street were cleaned and whitened every
  morning, and the few footmarks made by customers going in and coming
  out, gained for it the name of the &quot;Clean Bank,&quot; by which
  title it will be remembered by many. The business that had been
  collected was transferred to the Midland, and the New Street bank was
  closed.</p>

  <p>My sketch of the Birmingham Banks is now complete. It is very
  satisfactory to reflect that in the long space of sixty-three years
  over which it ranges, there have been only two cases in which the
  creditors of Birmingham banks have suffered loss; and really it is
  greatly to the credit of the good old town that these losses have
  been, comparatively, so insignificant. In the bankruptcy of Gibbins
  and Co., in 1825, the creditors received 19s. 8d. in the pound. In
  the more recent case&#8212;that of Attwood and Co.&#8212;they
  received a dividend of 11s. 3d. Both these cases compare favourably
  with others at a distance, where dividends of one or two shillings
  have not been infrequent. The banking business of the town is now in
  safe and prudent hands, and there is strong reason for hoping that
  the several institutions may go on, with increasing usefulness and
  prosperity, to a time long after the present generation of traders
  has ceased to draw cheques, or existing shareholders to calculate
  upon coming dividends.</p>

  <p>As I stood, not long ago, within the splendid hall in which the
  Birmingham and Midland Bank carries on its business, my mind reverted
  to a visit I once paid, to the premises, in the City of Gloucester,
  of the first county bank established in England. Perhaps in all the
  differences between bygone and modern times, there could not be found
  a greater contrast. The old Gloucester Bank was established in the
  year 1716, by the grandfather of the celebrated &quot;Jemmy
  Wood,&quot; who died in 1836, leaving personal property sworn under
  £900,000. Soon after his death, I saw the house and &quot;Bank,&quot;
  where he had carried on his business of a &quot;banker and
  merchant.&quot; The house was an old one, the gables fronting the
  street. The upper windows were long and low, and were glazed with the
  old lead-framed diamond-shaped panes of dark green glass. The
  ground-floor was lighted by two ancient shop windows, having heavy
  wooden sashes glazed with panes about nine inches high by six wide.
  To the sill of each window, hung upon hinges, were long deal
  shutters, which were lifted up at night, and fastened with
  &quot;cotters.&quot; There were two or three well-worn steps to the
  entrance. The door was divided half-way up: the upper portion stood
  open during business hours, and the lower was fastened by a common
  thumb latch. To the ledge of the door inside, a bell was attached by
  a strip of iron hooping, which vibrated when the door was opened, and
  set the bell ringing to attract attention. The interior fittings were
  of the most simple fashion; common deal counters with thin oaken
  tops; shabby drawers and shelves all round; one or two antiquated
  brass sconces for candles; a railed-off desk, near the window; and
  that was all. In this place, almost alone and unassisted, the old man
  made his money. I copy the following from &quot;Maunder&#39;s
  Biographical Dictionary:&quot; &quot;In conjunction with the bank, he
  kept a shop to the day of his death, and dealt in almost every
  article that could be asked for. Nothing was too trifling for
  &#39;Jemmy Wood&#39; by which a penny could be turned. He spent the
  whole week in his banking-shop or shop-bank, and the whole of the
  business of the Old Gloucester Bank was carried on at one end of his
  chandlery store.&quot;</p>

  <p>Now-a-days we go to a palace to cash a cheque. We pass through a
  vestibule between polished granite monoliths, or adorned with choice
  marble sculpture in <i>alto-relievo</i>. We enter vast halls fit for
  the audience chambers of a monarch, and embellished with everything
  that the skill of the architect can devise. We stand at counters of
  the choicest polished mahogany, behind which we see scores of busy
  clerks, the whole thing having an appearance of absolute splendour.
  Prom Jemmy Wood&#39;s shop to the noble hall of the Midland, or the
  Joint Stock, is indeed a long step in advance.</p>

  <p>It has often occurred to me that it would be a wise plan for
  bankers to divide their counters into distinct compartments, so that
  one customer could see nothing of his next neighbour, and hear
  nothing of his business. The transactions at a bank are often of as
  delicate a nature as the matters discussed in a solicitor&#39;s
  office; yet the one is secret and safe, and the other is open to the
  gaze and the ear of any one who happens to be at the bank at the same
  time.</p>

  <p>In closing this subject, I wish to express my thanks to Mr. S.A.
  Goddard for his assistance. His great age, his acute powers of
  perception, and his marvellously retentive and accurate memory,
  combine to make him, probably, the only living competent witness of
  some of the circumstances I have been able to detail; while the ready
  manner in which he responded to my request for information merits my
  warmest and most grateful acknowledgments.</p>

  <h2>JOHN WALSH WALSH AND THE ASTON FÊTES.</h2>

  <p>No one possessing ordinary habits of observation can have lived in
  Birmingham for anything like forty years without being conscious of
  the extraordinary difference between the personal and social habits
  of the generation which is passing away, and of that which has arisen
  to succeed it. Now-a-days, as soon as business is over, Birmingham
  people&#8212;professional men, manufacturers, shopkeepers, and,
  indeed, all the well-to-do classes&#8212;hurry off by rail, by
  tramway, or by omnibus, to snug country homesteads, where their
  evenings are spent by their own firesides in quiet domestic
  intercourse. A generation ago, things in Birmingham were very
  different. Then, shopkeepers lived &quot;on the premises,&quot; and
  manufacturers, as a rule, had their dwelling houses in close
  proximity to their factories. Business, compared with its present
  condition, was in a very primitive state. Manufacturers worked at
  their business with their men, beginning with them in the morning and
  leaving off at the same hour at night. The warehouse closed, and the
  work of the day being over, the &quot;master&quot; would doff his
  apron, roll down his turned-up shirt sleeves, put on his second-best
  coat, and sally forth to his usual smoking-room. Here, in company
  with a few old cronies, he solaced himself with a modest jug of ale,
  and, lighting his clay pipe, proceeded with great solemnity to enjoy
  himself. But, one by one, the <i>habitués</i> of the old smoking
  rooms have gone to &quot;live in the country,&quot; and the drowsy,
  dreary rooms, becoming deserted, have, for the most part, been
  applied to other purposes; whilst in many of those that are left, the
  smoke-stained portrait of some bygone landlord looks down upon the
  serried ranks of empty chairs, as if bewailing the utter degeneracy
  of modern mankind.</p>

  <p>The room at the &quot;Woodman,&quot; in Easy Row, is an exception,
  for it still maintains its ground. It is a large, well-lighted, and
  well-ventilated apartment. Its walls are adorned with a number of
  good pictures, among which are well-executed life-size portraits of
  two eminent men&#8212;James Watt, the engineer, and Sir Joshua
  Reynolds, the father of the English school of painting. In this room,
  years ago, when the sunny, courteous, and humorous &quot;Jem
  Onions&quot; was the host, a number of notable men used to assemble.
  Here you might meet men who at that time, or since, have been known
  as mayors, alder-men, and councillors. Here, &quot;Blue-brick
  Walker&quot; first propounded his scheme for superseding the
  &quot;petrified kidney&quot; pavement. Here &quot;Wedding-ring
  Edwards,&quot; in his quaint, sententious manner, growled out brief
  epigrammatic sentences, full of shrewdness and wisdom, most strangely
  seasoned with semi-contemptuous sarcasm. Here Isherwood Sutcliff,
  with his well-dressed, dapper figure, and his handsome Roman face,
  was wont to air his oratory; and here occasionally he, placing his
  right foot upon a spittoon, would deliver himself of set orations;
  most carefully prepared; most elegantly phrased; copiously garnished
  with Byronic quotations; and delivered with considerable grace and
  fervour. These orations, however, having no basis of thought or force
  of argument, and, indeed, having nothing but their sensuous beauty of
  expression to recommend them, fell flat upon the ears of an
  unsympathetic audience, composed mainly of men whose brains were
  larger and of tougher fibre. Here, too, came occasionally the mighty
  and the omniscient Joe Allday, and when he did, the discussion
  sometimes became a little more than animated, the self-assertive Joe
  making the room ring again, as he denounced the practices of those
  who ruled the destinies of the town. Here one night, lifting his
  right hand on high, as if to appeal to Heaven, he assured his
  audience that they &quot;need not be afraid.&quot; He would
  &quot;<i>never</i> betray the people of Birmingham!&quot; Here, too,
  last, but certainly not least in any way, might almost nightly be
  seen the towering figure of John Walsh Walsh: his commanding stature;
  his massive head, with its surrounding abundant fringe of wavy hair,
  looking like a mane; his mobile face, his bright&#8212;almost
  fierce&#8212;eye; his curt, incisive, and confident style of speech,
  showing him to be, beyond all question, the most masterful and
  prominent member of the company.</p>

  <p>He was born at Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire. His peculiar double
  patronymic was the result of a curious mistake made by one of the
  sponsors at his baptism. Being asked in the usual way to &quot;name
  this child,&quot; the poor man, in his nervousness, gave, not only
  the intended name of John, but inadvertently, the surname also; and
  so the infant became John Walsh Walsh, a name which its owner used to
  say was worth hundreds a year to him in business. &quot;Anybody could
  be &#39;John Walsh,&#39; but &#39;John Walsh Walsh&#39; was unique,
  and once heard would never be forgotten.&quot;</p>

  <p>Coming to Birmingham in pre-railway times, he found his first
  employment in the office of Pickford and Co., the great carrying
  firm. Here his marvellous energy, his quickness of apprehension, his
  mastery of detail, his accuracy of calculation, and his rapidity as a
  correspondent, soon raised him to a good position. He had, however,
  higher aims, and having the sagacity to foresee that the use of
  aërated beverages, which had just been introduced, must soon become
  general, he left the office and commenced the manufacture of soda
  water, a business which he successfully carried on as long as he
  lived, and which is still continued in his name by his successors.
  This business fairly afloat, his energies sought further outlet, and
  he soon, in conjunction with his partner, Mr. Nelson, commenced at
  Leamington the manufacture, by a patent process, of artificial
  isinglass and gelatine. This business, too, was successful and is
  still in operation, Nelson&#39;s gelatine being known all over the
  world. Besides these, he had a mustard mill, was an extensive dealer
  in cigars, and for many years was associated with the late Mr.
  Jefferies in the manufacture of marine glue. About 1851 he took over
  an unsuccessful co-operative glass manufactory in Hill Street, which
  his vigorous management soon converted into a great success. The
  business growing beyond the capabilities of the premises, he removed
  it to the extensive works at Lodge Road, where he continued to
  conduct it until his death, and where it is still carried on by his
  executors for the benefit of his family.</p>

  <p>He was for some years a member of the Birmingham Town Council, and
  was one of its hardest workers. Much might be said of the energetic
  manner in which he opposed all weakness in action, and of the manly
  vigour of his advocacy of all schemes for the benefit of the town of
  his adoption. It will be especially remembered how hard he worked to
  induce the Council to buy Aston Park for the town, when its price was
  low, and how he used to chafe at the thought that double the present
  area of the park might have been purchased, for less money than was
  ultimately paid for the portion now held. In the Council, as
  everywhere else, the strange influence he could bring to bear upon
  other men, and the power he possessed of infusing a portion of his
  own superabundant energy into the minds of others, was continually
  manifested; and he will long be remembered in the Council Chamber as
  one of the most original thinkers, and one of the shrewdest
  observers, that ever sat upon its benches.</p>

  <p>But his name will, probably, be longer held in remembrance in
  connection with the colossal fêtes at Aston Park, in 1856, of which
  he was the originator, and to the success of which he devoted himself
  with untiring energy and unwearied industry. The idea of the fêtes
  originated at the &quot;Woodman&quot; on an evening in the spring of
  1856. The room, on this occasion, was nearly full; Walsh occupied the
  principal seat. Not far from him was the versatile, erudite, somewhat
  dogmatic, but always courteous and polite, John Cornforth. There too,
  was Ambrose Biggs, who since, as Mayor, so fully justified the choice
  the Corporation made when they elected him to be their head. Nearly
  opposite was seen the gentlemanlike figure of poor Joseph Collins,
  whose untimely death, a few years later, created an intense feeling
  of sorrow in the minds of all who knew him. The worthy host, Jem
  Onions, occupied his usual seat. At a short distance was seen the
  upright figure and full round face of genial, but somewhat fussy,
  George Tye, his countenance beaming with good nature, and his eye
  bright with the light of poetic and artistic intelligence; and there
  also were many others, whose names I cannot at this moment
  recall.</p>

  <p>The conversation that night was more than usually animated, and
  was carried on with much propriety and intelligence. Walsh led a
  discussion on the folly of the Corporation in refusing to buy a
  portion of Aston Park, including the Hall, which had been offered to
  them, as he said, &quot;dirt cheap.&quot; Biggs, a little way off,
  took up a subject with which he was more intimately
  connected&#8212;the Queen&#39;s Hospital, whose financial affairs,
  just then, were in a lamentable state of collapse. One set of talkers
  in the room were intent upon the one topic; at the other end, the
  other subject was uppermost. Thus the two matters became somewhat
  &quot;mixed up&quot; in the ear of a listener, and thus they suddenly
  jostled together in the mind of Walsh. All in a moment the thought
  arose&#8212;&quot;Why not borrow the park and give a pic-nic for the
  hospital?&quot; With him, such a matter required little
  consideration; with him, to conceive was to act. In a few minutes he
  was on his legs, and at some length, with considerable eloquence and
  characteristic energy, he, amid the rapt attention of the company,
  propounded the scheme which had suggested itself. He was followed by
  other speakers; the scheme was rapturously received by the audience;
  it was unanimously resolved that if the use of the park could be
  obtained, the fête should be held; a deputation was appointed to wait
  upon the proprietors of the park; and a provisional committee, with
  Mr. Walsh as chairman, was elected to carry out the
  preliminaries.</p>

  <p>No time was lost. In a few days the desired permission to hold a
  fête in the park was obtained. Other gentlemen joined in the
  movement, and a large and influential permanent committee was formed.
  Walsh took up the matter with his usual energy and with most sanguine
  views. This was to be no <i>mere pic-nic</i> now! It was to be such a
  fête as Birmingham had never witnessed, and would not readily forget.
  The attractions were to be such as would draw people, from all
  quarters. The preparations were to be on the most gigantic scale, and
  the result was estimated by Walsh at a clear gain of £250 or £300 to
  the hospital. Some of the more cautious thought the scheme a little
  wild, and on far too extensive a scale for success; but the
  indomitable chairman, who had fully considered the <i>pros</i> and
  <i>cons</i>, threw into the movement the whole force of his almost
  superhuman energy, and carried conviction to the minds of the most
  timid of his colleagues. The scheme was enthusiastically resolved
  upon, although, as Walsh said, after the fêtes were over, &quot;Some
  of us were actually frightened at what we had undertaken.&quot;</p>

  <p>The fête was to be held on the 28th of July. It fell on a Monday.
  By common consent business was to be suspended. As the day
  approached, it became obvious, from the enormous demand for the
  tickets, that the attendance would far exceed the expectations of the
  most sanguine. Another 25,000 tickets were ordered from the printer,
  by telegraph. The refreshment contractors were advised of the vastly
  increased number of hungry customers they might expect. Bakers were
  set to work to provide hundreds of additional loaves. Orders were
  given for an extra ton or two of sandwiches. Scores more barrels of
  ale and porter came slowly into the park, where, within fenced
  enclosures, they were piled, two or three high, in double lines.
  Crates upon crates of tumblers, earthenware mugs, and plates arrived.
  Soda water, lemonade, and ginger beer were provided in countless
  grosses, and in fact everything for the comfort and convenience of
  visitors that the most careful forethought could suggest, was
  provided in the most lavish profusion.</p>

  <p>At length the day arrived. The weather was delightfully fine. The
  village of Aston was gaily decorated; the Royal Standard floated from
  the steeple, and the bells chimed out in joyous melody. The quaint
  Elizabethan gateway to the park was gay with unaccustomed bunting.
  The sober old Hall had a sudden eruption of colour, such as it had
  probably never known before. Flags of all colours, and with strange
  devices, met the eye at every turn. Waggon after waggon, laden with
  comestibles, filed slowly into the park. The rushing to and fro of
  waiters and other attendants showed that they expected a busy day of
  it. As noon approached, train after train deposited at the Aston
  station hundreds and thousands of gaily-attired Black Country people.
  Special trains ran from New Street as fast as they could be got in
  order; all the approaches to the park were crammed with serried
  lines&#8212;three or four abreast&#8212;of omnibuses, waggons, cabs,
  carts, and every other imaginable vehicle; whilst thousands upon
  thousands of dusty pedestrians jostled each other in the crowded
  roads. Fast as the ticket and money collectors could pass them
  through the gates, continuous streams poured on for hours, until at
  length the number of persons within the grounds exceeded the enormous
  total of fifty thousands!</p>

  <p>The old Hall was thrown open, and hundreds of people strolled
  through its quaint rooms and noble galleries. The formal gardens were
  noisy with unaccustomed merriment. From the terrace one looked upon
  preparations for amusements, and old English games of all
  descriptions. Platforms for dancing, and pavilions for musicians,
  stood here and there. Beyond, in the valley, a long range of poles
  and skeleton forms showed where the fireworks were in preparation.
  Down in a corner stood a large stack of firewood through which, when
  lighted, the &quot;Fire-King&quot; was to pass uninjured. Swings,
  merry-go-rounds, and Punch and Judy shows were rare attractions for
  the young; and soon the whole of that enormous assemblage of people,
  in the sunlight of a glorious July day, seemed to be thoroughly
  enjoying themselves.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in one corner, there arose a deep-toned murmur, like the
  sound of the roaring of the waves upon a broken shore. It deepened in
  tone and increased in volume, until the whole area of the park was
  filled with this strange sound. It was the noise of laughter
  proceeding simultaneously from fifty thousand throats! From a
  mysterious-looking shed in the valley opposite the terrace, Mr. John
  Inshaw and some of his friends had just launched a balloon, shaped
  like an enormous pig! Piggy rose majestically over that vast sea of
  upturned faces, which he seemed to regard with much attention. But at
  length, apparently disgusted at being so much laughed at, he started
  off in the direction of Coleshill, and, to the intense amusement of
  everybody, persisted in travelling tail foremost.</p>

  <p>All classes were represented at the fête. Here you might see a
  group of well-dressed folks from Edgbaston, next some pale-faced
  miners from the Black Country, and then the nut-brown faces of some
  agricultural people. All seemed intent upon fun and pleasure, and so,
  throughout that long summer day, the crowd increased, and every one
  seemed to be in a state of absolute enjoyment.</p>

  <p>As evening wore on, other sources of interest arose. The famous
  Sycamore Avenue&#8212;now, alas, going fast to decay&#8212;was
  lighted up by innumerable coloured lamps. I am old enough to remember
  the illuminations of the famous Vauxhall Gardens in London, but I
  never saw there so fairylike a scene as that glorious old avenue at
  Aston presented that evening.</p>

  <p>Then came the fireworks! No such display had ever before been seen
  in the Midland Counties. The nights of rockets, the
  marvellously-ingenious set pieces, and the wonderful blue lights,
  gave intense delight; and the grand chorus of &quot;Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot;
  when any specially brilliant effect was produced, was something not
  to be easily forgotten; but the climax was reached when, as a finale,
  the words</p>

  <center>
    <b>SAVE ASTON HALL</b>
  </center>

  <p>came out in glowing fire. Then the people shouted and applauded as
  if they were frantic. And so, amid the gratulations of everybody, the
  first of the Aston Fêtes came to an end.</p>

  <p>No sooner was the fête over, than a clamour arose as to the
  disposal of the profit. It was argued that as the money raised had so
  far exceeded expectation, it ought, in fairness, to be divided
  between the two hospitals. Correspondence in the newspapers became
  warm, and almost angry. Walsh was pestered with all sorts of
  suggestions, and a deputation waited upon him, urging the
  &quot;claims&quot; of the General Hospital. Walsh received them with
  politeness, but with reticence, and they left dissatisfied. It was a
  difficulty, but Walsh was equal to it. Summoning his committee, he
  urged that the fête having been given for a specific purpose, that
  purpose must be fulfilled, and the whole sum must go to the
  Queen&#39;s. &quot;But,&quot; said he, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what
  we can do: we can give a good round sum on account to the
  Queen&#39;s, and we can get up another fête for the General.&quot; A
  bomb-shell could hardly have created greater astonishment, and the
  project, at first, was met with disfavour. It was thought that it
  would not &quot;do&quot; a second time; that the novelty of the
  affair was over; that people would not go twice; and that the result
  would be a failure. Walsh urged that what had been done had only
  &quot;whetted the appetite&quot; of the public; that thousands
  regretted not having been present; and that the result would be
  certain success. His energetic advocacy carried the point, and before
  the committee separated, a second fête, to be held on September 15th,
  was resolved upon.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, it was resolved to hand over a cheque for £1,500, on
  account, to the Queen&#39;s Hospital, which was accordingly done; and
  on the 22nd of August, at a meeting of the Council of the Hospital,
  at which Alderman Ratcliff presided, it was resolved (<i>inter
  alia</i>) that Walsh should be elected a Life Governor; that a marble
  tablet recording the event should be erected in the vestibule of the
  hospital; and that a dinner should be given to the chairman,
  officers, and committee of the fête, such dinner to take place at the
  &quot;Woodman,&quot; where the fête originated. The dinner
  subsequently took place, under the presidency of the late Mr. Thomas
  Upfill. It was stated incidentally that the total receipts amounted
  to £2,222 12s. 5d.; that donations had been received by the Fête
  Committee amounting to £93 13s.; and that they had secured annual
  subscriptions amounting to £26 14s. 6d.</p>

  <p>Pending these matters, Walsh and his friends had not been idle.
  Preparations for the second fête were commenced, and energetically
  urged forward. Guided by experience, the work was somewhat less
  laborious, but the dread of failure made the committee doubly
  anxious. Just before, there had been great rejoicing in London to
  celebrate the peace with Russia, and there had been a magnificent
  display of fireworks in Hyde Park. It was known that a considerable
  quantity, unused on that occasion, still lay in store at Woolwich
  Arsenal. Walsh opened a correspondence with the authorities; went to
  London; and finally induced the Government, not only to make a free
  grant of the fireworks, but to send down a staff of skilled
  pyrotechnists to superintend the display at the fête. Additional
  attractions in great abundance were provided. The Festival Choral
  Society promised its assistance, and everything augured well, if only
  the weather should be fine.</p>

  <p>Monday, September 15th, came at last. Fortunately, it was a very
  beautiful autumnal day. Nearly all the shops in the town were closed,
  and everybody talked of the fête. As the day wore on, the excitement
  became intense. The town literally emptied itself into Aston Park. A
  newspaper of the time, says, &quot;from the corner of Dale End to the
  park, the road was one continued procession of cabs, carts, and
  omnibuses, four abreast.&quot; Trains disgorged their thousands, and
  from far and near the people came pouring in, until, to the utter
  amazement of everybody, the park was considerably fuller than on the
  previous occasion, and the total number of visitors was estimated to
  be at least 90,000.</p>

  <p>Walsh was in his glory. With triumphant glee he mounted a chair on
  the terrace, and began a short speech, with the words,
  &quot;We&#39;re a great people, gentlemen; we&#39;re a great
  people.&quot; He then went on to say that he was &quot;going to turn
  auctioneer,&quot; and a huge clothes basket full of grapes&#8212;the
  entire contents of one of his own forcing houses&#8212;being brought
  to him, he proceeded in the most facetious manner to offer them,
  bunch by bunch, for sale, and he realised in this way a very large
  addition to the funds of the fête.</p>

  <p>But space fails, and the account of this, the second fête, must
  only record that in every respect it was a success; that, over and
  above the prodigious number of tickets that had been sold, the
  enormous sum of £1,200 was taken <i>at the gates</i> for admission;
  and that, financially as well as numerically, it far exceeded its
  predecessor.</p>

  <p>It only remains to add, that four days afterwards, Messrs. Walsh,
  Cornforth, Biggs, and Collins attended the Board Meeting of the
  General Hospital, and handed over a cheque for £1,700 on account;
  that at the next committee meeting it was resolved that the aggregate
  results of both fêtes should be ascertained, and that the amount of
  the entire profits of both should be divided in equal moieties
  between the two hospitals.</p>

  <p>So ended the great Aston Fêtes, the memory of which, and their
  financial results, will be perpetuated by the marble slab at the
  Queen&#39;s Hospital, which bears the following
  inscription&#8212;</p>

  <h2>G.F. MUNTZ, M.P.</h2>

  <p>The second Parliament of Queen Victoria was dissolved July 23rd,
  1847. Mr. Muntz had represented Birmingham in both, having been
  elected on the retirement of Mr. Attwood, in January, 1840, and
  re-elected at the general election in July, 1841. It was customary in
  Birmingham, before the passing of the last Reform Bill, to hold, on
  the eve of elections, a meeting of non-electors, in order that the
  working men, then outside the franchise, should have a
  &quot;voice,&quot; although they had no vote, in the choice of the
  Members for Birmingham. From 1844 Mr. Spooner had represented the
  town, but on this occasion the Liberal electors were determined, if
  possible, to eject him. Mr. William Scholefield opposed his
  re-election. There was another candidate, Mr. Sergeant Allen, but as
  he only polled 89 votes he may, for the present purpose, be left out
  of the question. The contest lay between Mr. Spooner and Mr.
  Scholefield. The leaders of the Liberal party naturally supposed that
  the candidature of Mr. Scholefield would have the support of Mr.
  Muntz, and that the two Liberal candidates would be able to work
  together, having a joint committee. To the astonishment of the whole
  town, Mr. Muntz resolutely declined to have anything to do with Mr.
  Scholefield or his friends. Upon this becoming known, there was great
  dismay in the Liberal camp, and Mr. Muntz became very unpopular. All
  kinds of proposals were made to induce him to change his mind, but he
  remained obstinate, and, in addition, stubbornly refused to canvass
  for himself, or to allow his friends to canvass in his name.</p>

  <p>Matters stood thus when the meeting of non-electors was held in
  the Town Hall. It was a very hot afternoon, and the hall was crammed.
  The leaders of the Liberal party took, as usual, the right of the
  chairman, and filled the principal seats in front. Mr. Muntz was
  &quot;conspicuous by his absence.&quot; The proceedings had gone on
  for some time, and on the name of Mr. William Scholefield being
  proposed as a candidate, the whole audience rose enthusiastically,
  and the Town Hall rung with cheers, such as the Liberals of
  Birmingham know so well how to bestow on a Liberal favourite or a
  Liberal sentiment. In the midst of this demonstration, when the
  meeting was in a state of fervid excitement, George F. Muntz quietly
  came up the orchestra stairs, and took unobserved a seat upon a back
  bench, near the organ. I was within two yards of him. He wore a brown
  holland blouse, and had with him a paper bag, and as he placed his
  hat on the seat beside him, he emptied the contents of the bag into
  it. As he did so I saw that he had provided himself with half-a-dozen
  oranges.</p>

  <p>In the course of the speeches that were made, much regret was
  expressed at the determination of Mr. Muntz to stand aloof from the
  party in this election, and it was hinted that if the Conservatives
  should retain the seat, Mr. Muntz personally would be to blame. Muntz
  heard it all pretty quietly, and at length, greatly to the
  astonishment of most who were there, who were not even aware of his
  being present, his stalwart figure rose, like an apparition, at the
  back of the gallery. Standing on a seat so as to make himself seen,
  he shouted out, &quot;Mr. Chairman!&quot; The applause which greeted
  him was met with sober silence by Mr. Scholefield&#39;s friends. He
  went on&#8212;I remember his very words&#8212;&quot;I was going into
  the Reform Club the other day, and on the steps I met Joe Parkes: you
  all know Joe Parkes. Well, he said to me, &#39;I say, Muntz, you must
  coalesce with Scholefield.&#39; I said, &#39;I shan&#39;t do anything
  of the sort; it is no part of my duty to dictate to my constituents
  who shall be my colleague, and I shan&#39;t do it.&#39;
  &#39;Well,&#39; he said, &#39;if you don&#39;t, I shall recommend the
  electors to plump against you.&#39; Well, I gave him a very short and
  a very plain answer: I told him they might plump and be damned!&quot;
  The uproar, the laughter, the shouts that ensued cannot be adequately
  described. In the midst of the din, Muntz coolly stooped, took a
  large orange from his hat, bit a piece out of it, which he threw
  away, and then facing that mighty and excited crowd, proceeded to
  suck away in as unconcerned a manner as if no one were present but
  himself. When the noise had somewhat subsided, he commenced an
  elaborate defence of his conduct, and said he had been taunted with
  being too proud to ask for the votes of the electors.
  &quot;That&#39;s not the reason,&quot; he said; &quot;I knew I had
  done my duty as your representative, and that I deserved your votes;
  and I knew that I should get them without asking; but if it is any
  satisfaction to anybody, I take this opportunity to ask you now,
  collectively, to vote for me. As for your second vote, that has
  nothing to do with me. Choose whom you may, I shall work cheerfully
  with him as a colleague, and I have no fear of the result.&quot;</p>

  <p>This little speech was altogether characteristic of the man. It
  showed his stubborn wilfulness, his intense egotism, his coarseness
  of manner, and his affectation of eccentricity. But it exhibited also
  the fact that he thoroughly understood that he was liked by the bulk
  of Birmingham people, and that he knew the majority of unthinking men
  would take his bluntness for manliness, and his defiance of the
  feelings and opinions of his political associates, for sturdy and
  commendable independence. He alienated many friends by his conduct on
  this occasion, but he won his election, coming in at the head of the
  poll. By dint of strenuous exertions&#8212;made necessary by his
  obstinacy&#8212;Mr. Scholefield came in second. The poll stood at the
  close&#8212;Muntz, 2,830; Scholefield, 2,824; Spooner, 2,302; Allen,
  89. From this time till his death, ten years later, he and Mr.
  Scholefield held their seats without further opposition.</p>

  <p>In the House of Commons he succeeded, mainly by force of lungs, in
  gaining attention; but he was looked upon as a political oddity,
  whose utterings were amusing, if nothing more. The only good I
  remember him to have done as a Member of Parliament was inducing the
  Government of the day to adopt the perforating machine in the
  manufacture of postage stamps.</p>

  <p>His personal appearance was remarkable and handsome. He was tall
  and exceedingly muscular, and must have possessed enormous physical
  power. At a time when shaving was universal, he wore his beard. It is
  generally believed that he never shaved. This is a mistake. He shaved
  until he was nearly 40 years old. His youngest brother, Mr. P.H.
  Muntz, the present M.P., as a young man had been sent for some years
  to North Germany, and when he came home in 1833, he had a fine beard.
  Mr. G.F. Muntz thereupon resolved to allow his to grow, and when he
  went to Parliament this peculiarity attracted much notice. H.B., the
  celebrated caricaturist, was not slow to make it the subject of one
  of his inimitable sketches. In the collected edition there are 917 of
  these famous pictures, all admirably drawn, and excellent likenesses.
  Mr. Muntz is depicted in No. 643, under the title of &quot;A
  Brummagem M.P.&quot; The historical stick, the baggy trousers, and
  the flowing and Homeric beard, are graphically represented. The
  reason given for his carrying the stick was quite amusing. It was
  stated that the then Marquis of Waterford had made a wager that he
  would shave Muntz, and that Muntz carried the stick to prevent that
  larkish young nobleman from carrying the intention into practice.</p>

  <p>The family from which Mr. Muntz descended was originally Polish,
  but for a few generations had been domiciled in France, where they
  occupied a handsome chateau, and belonged to the aristocracy of the
  country. Here the father of Mr. Muntz was born. At the time of the
  Revolutionary deluge that swept over France, the Muntz family, in
  common with so many hundreds of their countrymen, emigrated; and
  after a time, a younger son, Mr. Muntz&#39;s father, who seems to
  have been a man of great enterprise and force of character, became a
  merchant at Amsterdam. This step was very displeasing to his
  aristocratic relatives, but he followed his own course independently.
  In a few months he left Amsterdam for England, and established
  himself in Birmingham. At the age of 41 he married an English lady,
  Miss Purden, she being 17 years of age, and they resided in the house
  in Newhall Street now occupied by Messrs. Benson and Co., merchants,
  as offices, where, in the month of November, 1794, Mr. George
  Frederic Muntz was born. It is believed that his baptismal names were
  given him in honour of Handel, the composer. At the time of his birth
  the house stood amid fields and gardens, and the old mansion known as
  &quot;New Hall,&quot; was in close proximity, standing on the ground
  now occupied by the roadway of Newhall Street, just where the hill
  begins to descend towards Charlotte Street.</p>

  <p>The mother of Mr. Muntz was a lady of great acquirements and
  considerable mental power. She undertook the early education of her
  son, and was singularly qualified for the work. At the age of 12 he
  was sent to a school at Small Heath, kept by a Dr. Currie, where he
  remained for one year, and from that time he never received any
  professional instruction. He had, however, a hunger for knowledge
  that was insatiable, and, with the assistance of his excellent
  mother, he pursued his studies privately. He became very well up in
  ancient and modern history. At a very early age he was associated
  with his father in business, and soon became a very apt assistant.
  His father&#39;s somewhat premature death in 1811 brought him, at the
  early age of 18, face to face with the stern realities of life, for
  he became, so to speak, the head of the family, and the mainstay of
  the two businesses with which his father had been connected&#8212;the
  rolling mills in Water Street and the mercantile establishment in
  Great Charles Street. There he continued a hard-working, plodding;
  life for many years; but on the fortunate discovery of the fact that
  a peculiar alloy of sixteen parts of copper with ten and two-thirds
  of spelter made a metal as efficacious for the sheathing of
  ships&#39; bottoms as copper itself, at about two-thirds the cost, he
  left the management of the old concerns pretty much to his brother,
  the present Member, and devoted his own energies to the development
  of the business of making &quot;Muntz&#39;s Metal.&quot; This
  business secured him a colossal fortune, and his name as the
  fortunate discoverer is still familiar in every commercial market in
  the world.</p>

  <p>Mr. Muntz married early in life the daughter of a clergyman, by
  whom he had a large family. He resided first at a pretty rustic place
  overgrown with ivy, near Soho Pool, called Hockley Abbey. From thence
  he removed to Ley Hall, near Perry Barr; and finally he went to
  Umberslade Hall, near Knowle, where he resided for the remainder of
  his life.</p>

  <p>After the great commercial panic of 1825, the question of the
  proper adjustment of the English currency became a prominent topic of
  discussion, and various sections of society held contradictory
  theories. A distinct school of thought upon this subject arose in
  Birmingham, and comprised amongst its members some very able men of
  all shades of general political opinion. It became famous, and its
  theories being urged with great skill and ability, forced themselves
  upon public attention. Mr. Muntz, as a very young man, embraced their
  opinions, and advocated them by tongue and pen. In 1829 he wrote a
  series of letters to the Duke of Wellington upon this subject, which
  were marked by great ability. It was not, however, until the
  agitation for the Reform Bill commenced that Mr. Muntz became much
  known as a politician. He took up this cause with great ardour, and,
  being gifted with considerable fluency of speech, a powerful voice, a
  confident manner, and a handsome presence, he soon became immensely
  popular. Thomas Attwood, Joshua Scholefield, and George Frederic
  Muntz were the founders of the Political Union. The two former, as
  president and vice-president respectively, were of course in the
  foremost rank, but their young and ardent lieutenant, Muntz, was as
  powerful and popular as they. His strong and manly voice, and bold
  outspoken words, had a strange and powerful influence with his
  audiences. He was a popular favourite, and when the Political Union
  held their first monster meeting at Beardsworth&#39;s Repository, on
  January 25th, 1830, Muntz was the chairman. As has been written of
  him, &quot;His burly form, his rough-and-ready oratory, his thorough
  contempt for all conventionalities, the heartiness of his
  objurgations, and his earnestness, made him a favourite of the
  people, and an acceptable speaker at all their gatherings.&quot; When
  Earl Grey, who, as Premier, had endeavoured unsuccessfully to pass a
  Reform Bill, resigned, and &quot;the Duke&quot; took his place, bells
  throughout the country were tolled, and black flags floated from many
  a tower and steeple. The country was in a frenzy of anger and
  disappointment. A monster meeting was held on Newhall Hill, and
  there, in half a dozen words, Muntz sounded the knell of the new Tory
  Ministry. In tones such as few lungs but his could produce, he
  thundered in the ears of attentive and eager listeners the words,
  &quot;To stop the Duke, run for gold.&quot; There were no telegraphs
  in those days, but these words were soon known through the country. A
  run commenced, such as had seldom been known before, and if it had
  continued would have produced disastrous effects. The Duke was
  furious. Warrants were prepared for the apprehension of Attwood,
  Scholefield, and Muntz, for sedition; but the Ministry had not
  courage to put them in action. The excitement became more and more
  intense, and the great Duke, for the first time in his life, was
  compelled to yield. He resigned, and the unsigned warrants were found
  in the pigeon-holes at the Home Office by his successors.</p>

  <p>The Tory party&#8212;Conservatives had not then been
  invented&#8212;seeing how hopeless the struggle was in which they
  tried to defeat the nation, gave way eventually, and the Reform Bill
  of 1832 became law. The president and vice-president of the Political
  Union&#8212;Attwood and Scholefield&#8212;became the first Members
  for Birmingham, and political feeling was quiet for a time. It was
  soon seen, however, that, although the people had taken the outworks,
  the citadel of corruption had not yet been completely conquered. The
  church-rate question rose to the front, and became a burning matter
  of dispute. In Birmingham, on this question, public opinion ran very
  high. For many years the church-rate had been sixpence and ninepence
  in the pound per annum. This was felt to be a most intolerable burden
  by Churchmen themselves, and the Dissenters thought it a most unjust
  and unrighteous imposition. For some years there had been very angry
  discussions on the subject, and most unseemly altercations at the
  vestry meetings. On Easter Tuesday, the 28th March, 1837, a meeting
  was called for the election of the churchwardens of St. Martin&#39;s,
  and for the making of a rate. It was held in the Church. The Rev. Mr.
  Moseley, rector; Mr. Joseph Baker, who at that time was clerk to Mr.
  Arnold, the Vestry Clerk; Mr. Gutteridge, surgeon; Mr. Freer, and
  others, took their places in a pew on the north side of the organ.
  Mr. Muntz, Mr. George Edmonds, Mr. Pare, Mr. Trow, and others in
  great numbers, sat on the south. The Rector took the chair, and
  proposed Mr. Reeves as his warden for the coming year. To this, of
  course, there was no opposition, but on the rector saying he should
  now proceed to elect a people&#39;s warden, a row began. Mr. Pare
  contended that the rector&#8212;<i>ex officio</i>&#8212;had no right
  to act as chairman while the parishioners elected <i>their</i>
  warden. Muntz proposed another chairman; the parish books were
  demanded to be shown; but Mr. Baker put them under his feet and stood
  upon them. Muntz mounted to the top of the pew and demanded the
  books, and a scene of great disorder and riot ended in nothing being
  done. The whole scene appears to have been one of indescribable
  confusion. The rector was a timid, nervous man, who seemed during the
  whole proceedings to have almost lost his wits. When Baker refused to
  give up the books, a rush was made upon the rector&#39;s pew, amid
  cries of &quot;Pitch him over,&quot; &quot;Get the books,&quot;
  &amp;c. The panelling of the pew was smashed to atoms. In the midst
  of the scene, Muntz&#39;s burly form was seen, brandishing his
  well-known stick. Gutteridge is described as &quot;making incessant
  grimaces and gesticulations, in a manner which induced the crowd to
  call him &#39;Punch,&#39; and to ask him why he had not brought
  &#39;Judy&#39; with him.&quot; In fact, the whole proceeding was a
  disgraceful brawl.</p>

  <p>For his complicity in this business a criminal information was
  laid against Muntz, and he was brought, with two or three others, to
  trial at Warwick, before Chief Justice Park and a special jury. The
  charge was &quot;tumult, riot, and assault upon Gutteridge and
  Rawlins.&quot; The trial commenced on Friday, March 30, 1838, and
  lasted three entire days. The result was a virtual acquittal, Mr.
  Muntz having been found guilty of &quot;an affray,&quot; and not
  guilty on the other twelve counts of the indictment. Campbell was
  counsel for the prosecution, and Wilde for the defence, and some
  sparring took place between them. Campbell in a very rude and
  insulting manner, <i>chaffed</i> Muntz about his beard, and Wilde
  retorted with considerable scorn. The cost of the defence was over
  £2,000.</p>

  <p>In January, 1840, upon the retirement of Mr. Attwood from
  Parliament, Mr. Muntz became a candidate for the vacant seat, and was
  opposed by the notoriously bigoted Tory, Sir Charles Wetherell. The
  association of his name with the riots at Bristol a few years before
  did not add to his prospects of success in Birmingham. It was
  thought, however, that his relationship to Mr. Spooner would give him
  a chance, but the poll showed 1,454 votes for Mr. Muntz, and only 915
  for Sir Charles.</p>

  <p>From the time of his entering the House of Commons, Mr.
  Muntz&#39;s political and public character seems to have become
  deteriorated. Whether increasing riches brought increasing
  conservatism of thought can be hardly ascertained now; but there is
  no doubt that from this time the hereditary aristocratic tendencies
  of his mind began to gather force. The head of the paternal tree had
  long returned from exile to the family chateau, and resumed the
  position of a landed seigneur; and his son, George Louis Muntz,
  cousin of George Frederic, had just been elected a Member of the
  French Chamber of Deputies. Why should not the Muntzes become a
  family of equal position in England? No doubt this feeling became a
  ruling passion, and influenced his every thought.</p>

  <p>Still, he was a very vain man, and had always told his friends,
  publicly and privately, that at least <i>he</i> was politically
  honest and consistent; and he was desirous&#8212;spite of his change
  of views&#8212;to retain this self-given character. Hence all sorts
  of eccentricities, inconsistencies, and absurdities. Hence his
  constant habit of speaking one way and voting another, and hence his
  morbid sensitiveness to anything like adverse criticism. In fact,
  from this time he became utterly incomprehensible, and but for the
  grateful recollection of the many services of his younger days, would
  probably have found himself deserted by his political friends.</p>

  <p>At this time, too, the egotism, which in his later years became
  more manifest, began to show itself. He evidently thought himself
  <i>somebody</i>, and did not hesitate to say so on all occasions;
  until, at length, it was painful to listen to a speech of his. I
  remember, about the time of the Crimean war, when the organisation of
  the English army was found to be so lamentably deficient, there was a
  society established in Birmingham called by some such name as
  &quot;The Administrative Reform Association.&quot; A large meeting
  was held in Bingley Hall, at which all the leading Liberals of the
  town were present. George Dawson made a capital speech, and Muntz had
  &quot;a long innings.&quot; As we came out, poor Dawson said to me,
  &quot;They won&#39;t be able to print Muntz&#39;s speech
  verbatim.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; said I. &quot;Why, my dear
  fellow, no printing office in the world would have capital I&#39;s
  enough.&quot;</p>

  <p>I have spoken of his dislike to adverse criticism. No one, now,
  can imagine how he would rage and fume if any newspaper dared to
  doubt the wisdom of any remark of his. Why, he nearly killed poor
  Chidlow, the bookseller; shaking him almost to pieces for merely
  selling a paper in which he was severely criticised. While as for
  <i>The Birmingham Journal</i>, no red rag ever fluttered in the eyes
  of a furious bull ever caused more rage than the sight of that paper
  did to Muntz. That <i>they</i> should dare to doubt <i>his</i>
  infallibility was a deadly crime and an unpardonable sin.</p>

  <p>In opposition to this paper, Muntz started a paper of his own,
  <i>The Birmingham Mercury</i>, by which he lost a good deal of money,
  and did little good. The debts in connection with this newspaper were
  not paid until after his death.</p>

  <p>He certainly was a psychical curiosity, and his ways were
  &quot;past finding out.&quot; He was bold and fearless physically,
  but there his courage ended. He avowed himself to be a Republican,
  yet he was an innate aristocrat. He was always declaiming against
  despotism and tyranny in the abstract, yet he was domineering and
  arbitrary in his household, in his family, and in his business. He
  affected primitive simplicity, yet was one of the vainest of men. In
  fact, his whole nature was a living contradiction.</p>

  <p>About the year 1852 he lost, by death, his youngest daughter, to
  whom he had been devotedly attached. This was a severe blow to him,
  and from this time the robust physical frame began to exhibit tokens
  of decay. His hair became gray, and streaks of silver were seen in
  his magnificent beard. At the election in March, 1857, it was
  observed that he had greatly changed. He continued to attend the
  House of Commons until the end of May, when he was somewhat suddenly
  taken severely ill. It was discovered by the medical attendants that
  internal tumours, of an alarming nature, had formed, and from this
  moment his recovery seemed hopeless. He bore his illness with great
  firmness, although his weakness became pitiable, and the fine frame
  diminished to a mere skeleton. He became at length unconscious, and
  on the 30th of July, 1857, he quietly passed away in the presence of
  his family.</p>

  <p>The disposition of his vast wealth was marked by great
  eccentricity. His will, when published, caused much adverse
  criticism, and uncomplimentary epithets were freely used. Suffice it
  to say here, that his property was most unequally, if not unfairly,
  divided amongst his family, and that he did not leave a farthing to
  the Charities of the town of his birth&#8212;the town which had done
  so much for him, and for which he had always professed so much
  attachment.</p>

  <h2>JOSEPH GILLOTT.</h2>

  <p>About a hundred and fifty years ago, a gentleman, whose name I
  have not been able to ascertain, owned the premises in Icknield
  Street West, now known as Monument House, and in his garden, near the
  house, he built the tall octagonal tower, now known as the Monument,
  respecting the origin of which so many various legendary stories are
  current. It was, no doubt, erected to enable its owner, who was an
  astronomer, to obtain from its upper chamber a more extensive field
  of view for his instruments, and thus to enable him to make
  observations of the heavenly bodies when they were very low down in
  the horizon. I am informed, however, by an old inhabitant of
  Edgbaston, that his father told him, when a little boy, that it, was
  built by a gentleman named Parrott, who formerly lived in the top
  house in Bull Street, at the corner of Steelhouse Lane. This
  gentleman had removed to the house now called Monument House, and
  built the &quot;Monument&quot; in his garden to enable him&#8212;when
  from age he became too much enfeebled to enjoy it himself&#8212;to
  watch from its upper storeys the sport of coursing, which was
  extensively practised in the pleasant fields and meadows which then
  surrounded the house. Be that as it may, it is certain that the tower
  was, a century ago, known by the name of &quot;Parrott&#39;s
  Folly.&quot;[A]</p><a name="note-A" id="note-A"><!--Note--></a>

  <p class="foot"><u>A</u> [ In a Directory for the year 1800, Monument
  House is named as the residence of Mr. Parrott Noel.]</p>

  <p>From the top storey of this lofty building there was a very
  extensive range of vision, but when first built there was little to
  be seen but green fields and open country. Of the few buildings
  visible, Ladywood House, still standing, occupied the foreground, and
  was surrounded by a pleasant park. Apparently just beyond was the
  fine old mansion known as New Hall, which stood where now Great
  Charles Street intersects Newhall Street, the present roadway being
  the very site which the house then occupied. St. Philip&#39;s Church
  was being built, and the scaffold of its unfinished tower and dome
  looked like a huge net of wickerwork. A little to the left, Aston
  Hall, in the clear atmosphere, seemed only about a mile away. Beyond,
  on a gentle eminence, Coleshill was distinctly visible, and in the
  far distance the tower of St. Mary&#39;s Church at Coventry reared to
  the dim and hazy sky its exquisitely tapered and most graceful
  spire.</p>

  <p>I stood within this upper room, a few years ago, on a pleasant
  evening in the summer-time. From its windows there is still a very
  extensive view, but how changed! On all sides but one there is
  nothing to be seen, under the dingy cloud of smoke, but a weary,
  bewildering mass of dismal brick and mortar; and even on the
  north-west, where there are still a few green fields and pleasant
  gardens in the neighbourhood of the two reservoirs, the eye, reaching
  beyond there, comes upon the dark and forbidding regions to the west
  of Dudley. As on that glorious evening I turned my telescope to this
  point, I was startled by a very curious sight. I had placed the
  instrument in such a manner that its &quot;field&quot; was completely
  filled by the ruby-coloured disc of the setting sun. As I looked, I
  saw the singular apparition of a moving &quot;whimsey&quot; at the
  top of Brierley Hill, dark and black against the shining surface. It
  was an extraordinary illusion, for it looked exactly as if the rising
  and falling beam of the engine were attached to the surface of the
  sun itself.</p>

  <p>On the same side, I saw, almost at the foot of the tower on which
  I stood, a little enclosed garden. It contained at one end a long,
  low, pavilion-like building, and, here and there, some pleasant
  alcoves and garden seats. I heard the sound of merry voices, and, I
  saw two or three sets of gentlemen playing the game known by the
  unpoetical name of &quot;quoits.&quot; Upon inquiry I was told that
  this was the private ground of the Edgbaston Quoit Club, a select
  body, consisting mainly of well-to-do inhabitants of that pleasant
  suburb. By the courtesy of one of the members, I was a few days
  afterwards conducted over these premises. It was not a club day, so
  we were alone. The low pavilion, was, I found, the dining-room of the
  club&#8212;for on club days the members met to dine, as a preliminary
  to the play. It was plainly and very comfortably furnished, and every
  arrangement seemed to have been made that could conduce to the
  convenience of the members. At one end was a long row of hat-pegs,
  and upon these, at various angles, hung a singular assortment of
  garden hats and caps, of every imaginable shape and colour. They were
  the <i>négligé</i> head-coverings of the members, and though
  altogether dissimilar in most respects, they were alike in
  one&#8212;they were all of very large size.</p>

  <p>Phrenologists tell us that the size of a man&#39;s head is
  indicative of his mental power, and these hats certainly bore out the
  theory, for their owners were mostly self-made men, and were, without
  exception, men of mark. I will not mention the name of any of those
  now living, but two of the largest hats there belonged respectively
  to Walter Lyndon and Joseph Gillott.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gillott, we are told, in a newspaper published soon after his
  death, was &quot;born of poor but honest parents.&quot; I should like
  very much to inquire here, how it is that novel writers, magazine
  contributors, and newspaper reporters always write &quot;poor
  <i>but</i> honest.&quot; Is there really anything antithetic or
  antagonistic in poverty and honesty? To my mind the phrase always
  seems offensive, and it will be well if it is discontinued in the
  future. It is one of those little bits of clap-trap so common among
  reporters, who use phrases of this kind continually, without a
  thought as to their appropriateness.</p>

  <p>However, Joseph Gillott was born in Sheffield about three months
  before the present century commenced. His parents <i>were</i> poor,
  but they managed to give him a good plain education, and they taught
  him self-reliance. They taught him, too, to train and cultivate the
  fine faculty of observation with which he was naturally endowed. In
  very early life, we are told, he, by forging and grinding the blades
  of pen-knives, contributed greatly to the income of the parental
  household. It is said that even at a very early age, his quick
  perception and his acute nervous organisation enabled him to produce
  much finer work than others of far greater experience in the same
  trade, whose obtuseness had kept them in a state of comparative
  drudgery all their lives.</p>

  <p>When he became of age, and was &quot;out of his time,&quot; the
  cutlery trade in Sheffield was very much depressed, and he came to
  Birmingham, hoping to obtain employment in a trade which, owing to a
  caprice of fashion, was just then in an inflated condition. This was
  the business of making steel buckles, and other articles of polished
  steel for personal adornment. In this he was very successful, and
  soon after his arrival in the town, he took a small house in Bread
  Street, a little way down on the right from Newhall Street, and here
  he started business for himself. He had no capital, but he had great
  skill. Mr. S.A. Goddard, who used to buy from him, tells me that he
  made very excellent goods, and &quot;came for his money every
  week.&quot; He was a very excellent workman, and possessing as he did
  the native perception of fitness which we call &quot;taste,&quot; he
  soon obtained abundance of orders, and became prosperous.</p>

  <p>At this time the steel pen trade, which has since grown to such
  enormous dimensions, was only in a tentative condition. Josiah Mason,
  in conjunction with Perry, of <i>The Morning Chronicle</i> newspaper,
  was experimenting, and two brothers, named respectively John and
  William Mitchell, were actually making, by a tedious method, a fairly
  good article. They were assisted in their work by a sister. By some
  fortunate accident, Gillott and Miss Mitchell met, and after a brief
  courtship they entered into an engagement to marry. She spoke to her
  intended husband of the nature of her occupation, and Gillott at once
  conceived the idea that the <i>press</i>, the useful implement then
  used principally in the button trade, might, if proper tools could be
  made to suit, produce pens in large numbers very rapidly. With his
  own hands, in a garret of his house, he secretly worked until he had
  succeeded in making pens of a far better quality than had yet been
  seen. His process was one in which, unassisted, he could produce as
  many pens as twenty pairs of hands, working under the old system,
  could turn out. There was an enormous demand for his goods, and as he
  wanted help, and secrecy seemed needful, the young people married,
  and Mr. Gillott used to tell how, on the very morning of his
  marriage, he, before going to the church, made with his own hands a
  gross of pens, and sold them at 1s. each, realising thereby a sum of
  £7 4s.</p>

  <p>Continuing to live in the little house in Bread Street, the young
  couple worked in the garret, no one else assisting. As an
  illustration of the primitive condition of the steel pen trade then,
  it may be mentioned that at this period the pens were
  &quot;blued&quot; and varnished in a common frying-pan, over a
  kitchen fire. Orders flowed in so rapidly, and the goods were
  produced in such quantities, that the young couple made money faster
  than they knew what to do with it. They were afraid to invest it, as
  they did not wish it to ooze out that the business was so profitable.
  It has been stated that Mr. Gillott had several banking accounts open
  at this time, being afraid that, if he paid all his profits into one
  bank, it might excite cupidity, and so engender competition. It is
  also said that he actually buried money in the cellar of his house,
  lest his marvellously rapid accumulation of wealth should become
  known.</p>

  <p>At length the demand for his pens became so great that it was
  impossible to resist the urgent necessity for larger premises and
  increased labour. Mr. Gillott, accordingly, removed to Church Street,
  and subsequently took other premises, up the yard by Mr. Mappin&#39;s
  shop in Newhall Street. About the same time, he removed his family to
  the house at the corner of Great Charles Street, where the
  Institution of Mechanical Engineers had its offices until its recent
  removal to London. After a few years, he commenced to build the
  premises in Graham Street, where the business has, ever since, been
  carried on. At the time the building was erected, there were few
  &quot;factories,&quot; properly so called, in the town, and most of
  the work of the place was conducted in the low, narrow ranges of
  latticed-windowed buildings known as &quot;shopping.&quot; Mr.
  Gillott&#39;s was, I think, the first Birmingham building in the
  modern factory style. It was admirably planned, and expensively
  built. Even, now, when hundreds of factories have arisen, its solid
  and substantial appearance externally, and the arrangements inside,
  for order, and for the organisation of labour, are not surpassed by
  any of its rivals.</p>

  <p>As soon as Mr. Gillott&#39;s appliances were of sufficient extent
  to supply very large quantities, he commenced to advertise
  extensively, a practice which he continued during the remainder of
  his life, and which his son and successor still follows up in a
  modified form. I perfectly remember, more than forty years ago, his
  advertisements in tine magazines, and on the cover of the &quot;Penny
  Cyclop&aelig;dia.&quot; Like everything that Mr. Gillott did, they bore
  the impress of original thought. After giving his name and address,
  and a few other particulars as to his wares, the advertisements went
  on to say something like this:</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
    &quot;The number of pens produced in this factory in the year
    ending December 31st, 1836, was

    <p>250,000 grosses,<br>
    or 3,000,000 dozens,<br>
    or 36,000,000 pens.&quot;</p>
  </div>

  <p>The advertisements invariably had the fac-simile of Mr.
  Gillott&#39;s signature, as now; a signature better known, perhaps,
  than any other in the world, and one with which almost every human
  being who can write is perfectly familiar. Of course it will be
  understood that the quantities given above are altogether imaginary.
  It is impossible to remember the exact figures after so many years,
  but they are inserted to show the form the advertisements then
  took.</p>

  <p>Faster than the improved facilities at his command enabled him to
  produce, came the demand for his pens. To meet this, he brought from
  time to time into use many mechanical appliances, the product of his
  fertile and ingenious brain, until at length every one of the old
  processes was superseded, and labour-saving machinery substituted.
  The price of the pens fell from a shilling each to less than that sum
  per gross, and the steel pen came into universal use. The enormous
  number of yens produced in Mr. Gillott&#39;s works can scarcely be
  set down in figures, but may be estimated roughly, from the statement
  made at the time of his death that the average weight of the weekly
  make of finished pens exceeded five tons. I have tried, by
  experiment, to arrive at an approximate estimate of the <i>number</i>
  of pens this weight represents. I have taken a &quot;scratch&quot;
  dozen of pens, of all sorts and sizes, and ascertaining their weight,
  have calculated therefrom, and I find that the result is something
  like sixty thousand grosses, or the enormous number of nearly nine
  millions of separate pens, sent out from this manufactory every
  week.</p>

  <p>In the course of the forty or fifty years during which Mr. Gillott
  was in business, many other manufactories of steel pens were
  established, at some of which, probably, greater <i>numbers</i> of
  pens were produced than at his own, but the <i>amount of business</i>
  transacted was in no case, probably, so great. Mr. Gillott did not
  compete in the direction others took&#8212;lowness of price. Like his
  brother-in-law, Mr. William Mitchell, he preferred to continue to
  improve the quality. It is somewhat remarkable that, after long years
  of active and severe competition, these two houses&#8212;the oldest
  in the trade, I believe&#8212;have still the highest reputation for
  excellence.</p>

  <p>It has often occurred to me that the invention of steel pens came
  most opportunely. Had they not been invented, Rowland Hill&#39;s
  penny postage scheme would probably have failed. There would not have
  been, in the whole world, geese enough to supply quills to make the
  required number of pens. Had Byron lived a little later on, his
  celebrated couplet would not have apostrophised the &quot;gray goose
  quill,&quot; but would probably have run something like this:</p>

  <div style="margin-left: 10%;">
  &quot;My Gillott pen! thou noblest work of skill,<br>
  Slave of my thought, obedient to my will.&quot;<br>
  </div>

  <p>My purpose, however, in this sketch is not to write a history of
  the trade by which Mr. Gillott raised himself to fame and fortune,
  but rather to describe the man himself, as he moved quietly and
  unobtrusively among his fellow men. One of his chief characteristics,
  it has always struck me, was his intense love of <i>excellence</i> in
  everything with which he had to do. It was a frequent jocular remark
  of his that &quot;the best of everything was good enough for
  him.&quot; In this&#8212;perhaps unknowingly&#8212;he followed Lord
  Bacon&#39;s advice, &quot;Jest in earnest,&quot; for he, certainly,
  earnestly carried out in life the desire to do, and to possess, the
  &quot;best&quot; that could be attained. Of this peculiarity, some
  very pleasant stories can be told.</p>

  <p>Soon after he had purchased the beautiful estate at Stanmore, near
  Harrow-on-the-Hill, which he loved so much, and where, in company
  with his old friend, Pettitt, the artist, he spent so much time in
  his latter years, he resolved to adorn the grounds with the rarest
  and most beautiful shrubs and trees obtainable. The trustees of the
  Jephson Gardens, at Leamington, about the same time, advertised for
  sale some surplus plants of rare kinds, and Mr. Gillott paid the
  gardens a visit. He had selected a number of costly specimens, when
  his eye fell on a tree of surpassing beauty. He inquired its price,
  and was told that it was not for sale. He was not a man to be easily
  baffled, and he still tried to make a bargain. He was at length told
  that an offer of £50 had already been made for the tree, and refused.
  His reply was characteristic: &quot;Well, I&#39;ve made up my mind to
  have that tree, and I&#39;ll give £100 for it. This offer, with the
  amount of those I have selected, will make my morning&#39;s purchases
  come to three or four hundred pounds. If I don&#39;t have this tree,
  I won&#39;t have any.&quot; He had it, and it still adorns the
  magnificent lawn at Stanmore.</p>

  <p>Few people know that he had a fancy for collecting precious
  stones, simply as rarities. Poor George Lawson (whose tall, erect,
  and soldier-like figure was well known in the streets of Birmingham
  and at picture sales, and whose thoroughly good-natured, genial,
  hearty manner, and singular wealth of humour, made him the favourite
  &quot;of all circles, and the idol of his own&quot;) told me a
  capital story illustrative of this. One of Mr. Lawson&#39;s daughters
  complained to him of tooth-ache, and he advised her to have it
  extracted. The young lady, who had inherited a large share of her
  father&#39;s rare humour, went immediately to the dentist and had the
  objectionable tooth removed. There had been a calf&#39;s head on the
  dinner-table that day, and the young lady, on her return, obtained
  from the cook one of the large molars from the jaw of the calf,
  which, having been carefully wrapped in paper, was presented to her
  father as her own. He saw through the trick in an instant, and
  affecting great astonishment at its enormous size, he put it in his
  waistcoat pocket, as a curiosity, forming in his own mind a little
  plot for the following day, when he had an engagement to dine out.
  The dinner party was at Walter Lyndon&#39;s house at Moseley, and
  here he met Gillott. Lawson, at table, was seated next to a gentleman
  from London, who wore on his forefinger a ring containing a very
  magnificent diamond; so large, indeed, as to excite Lawson&#39;s
  attention so much that at length he spoke, &quot;You must really
  excuse me, but I cannot help admiring the splendid diamond in your
  ring.&quot; &quot;Yes, it&#39;s a pretty good one,&quot; said the
  gentleman, handing it to Lawson for inspection. It was passed round
  the table until it reached Gillott, who carefully inspected it and
  said, &quot;It&#39;s a very good one; but I think I have one
  that&#39;ll &#39;lick&#39; it.&quot; Putting his hand into the breast
  pocket of his coat, he brought out two or three shabby-looking
  screwed-up bits of paper. Selecting one of these, he opened it, and
  produced therefrom an unmounted diamond, far surpassing in size and
  purity the one in the ring. Precious stones generally became at once
  the topic of conversation, and it was wondered whether an emerald of
  equal size would be of equal or, as one contended, even greater
  value. One gentleman present said that an emerald so large had never
  yet been seen. Gillott&#39;s eye twinkled with a merry humour, as,
  from another bit of paper, he produced an emerald larger than the
  diamond, and a minute afterwards trumped both these with a splendid
  ruby. It was now Lawson&#39;s turn. Assuming a serious look, he said
  that Mr. Gillott&#39;s specimens were certainly very remarkable, but
  he could &quot;beat them hollow.&quot; Then, with an air of great
  mystery and care, he produced from his pocket the carefully-enveloped
  tooth, which he exhibited to his astonished friends as the identical
  tooth taken from his daughter&#39;s jaw the day before.</p>

  <p>It is well known that Mr. Gillott had accumulated a very large and
  fine collection of violins and other stringed musical instruments.
  These, when sold by auction after his death, fetched, under the
  hammer, upwards of £4,000. About twenty years ago an old friend of
  mine in Leicestershire, who had met with some heavy losses, desired
  to sell a fine Stradivarius violin, which had been in his family more
  than a century, and he sent it to me that I might offer it to Mr.
  Gillott. I called upon him to ask permission to bring it to him for
  inspection. I can recall now the frank, honest, homely Yorkshire tone
  with which he said, &quot;Nay, lad! I shan&#39;t buy any more
  fiddles; I&#39;ve got a boat-load already.&quot; He wouldn&#39;t look
  at it, and I sent it back to its owner, who is long since dead.</p>

  <p>World-wide as was his reputation as a manufacturer, he was almost
  equally renowned as one of the most munificent and discriminating
  patrons of Art. Possessing, naturally, a most refined taste, and
  having very acute perceptive powers, he instinctively recognised the
  <i>true</i> in the work of young artists; and when he saw tokens of
  more than common ability, he fostered the budding talent in a very
  generous spirit. So much was thought of his judgment, that the fact
  of his having bought a picture by an unknown man was quite sufficient
  to give the artist a position. I heard a story from a Liverpool
  artist the other day, very characteristic of Mr. Gillott&#39;s firm
  and determined, yet kind and generous, nature. It is well known that
  he very early recognised the genius of the gifted Müller, and became
  his warm supporter. One result of his patronage was that others
  sought the artist, and by offers of large prices and extensive
  commissions, induced him to let them have some of his pictures, which
  Gillott was to have bought. Müller appears to have become inflated
  by his great success, and he, in this or some other way, managed to
  annoy his early friend and patron in a very serious manner. His
  punishment was swift, severe, and sure. Gillott immediately packed
  off every Müller picture he possessed to an auction room in London,
  with directions that they should be extensively advertised as his
  property, and sold without the slightest reserve. This step so
  frightened the Art-world that &quot;Müllers&quot; became a drug in
  the market, and poor Müller found himself neglected by his quondam
  friends. He soon came in penitence to Gillott, who again took him by
  the hand, and befriended him until his untimely death in 1845, at the
  age of 33. At the sale of Mr. Gillott&#39;s pictures after his
  decease, Müller&#39;s celebrated picture, &quot;The Chess
  Players,&quot; fetched the enormous sum of £3,950.</p>

  <p>The story of Mr. Gillott&#39;s introduction to the great landscape
  painter, Turner, has been variously told, but the basis of all the
  stories is pretty much the same. It seems that Gillott, long before
  Ruskin had dubbed Turner &quot;the modern Claude,&quot; had detected
  the rare excellence of his works, and longed to possess some. He went
  to the dingy house in Queen Anne Street, and Turner himself opened
  the door. In reply to Gillott&#39;s questions, he said he had
  &quot;nothing to sell that <i>he</i> could afford to buy.&quot;
  Gillott, by great perseverance, obtained admission, and tried at
  first to bargain for a single picture. Turner looked disdainfully at
  his visitor, and refused to quote a price. Still Gillott persevered,
  and at length startled the artist by asking, &quot;What&#39;ll you
  take for the lot in this room?&quot; Turner, half-jokingly, named a
  very large sum&#8212;many thousands&#8212;thinking to frighten him
  off, but Gillott opened his pocket book, and, to Turner&#39;s utter
  amazement, paid down the money in crisp Bank of England notes. From
  this moment the two men, so utterly unlike in their general
  character, but so strangely kindred in their love of Art, became on
  intimate terms of friendship, which lasted until Turner&#39;s death
  in 1851. Mr. Gillott&#39;s collection of Turner&#39;s works was the
  largest and finest in private hands in England, and, when they were
  sold, realised more than five times the money he had paid for
  them.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gillott was not, in any sense, a public man, and he took no
  active part in politics. He had a great dislike to public companies,
  and I believe never held a share in one. He had a very few old
  friends with whom he loved to associate. He was very hospitable, but
  he had a strong aversion to formal parties, and to every kind of
  ostentation. His chief delight was to act as cicerone to an
  appreciative visitant to his magnificent gallery. He was a frequent
  visitor to the snug smoking-room at the &quot;Hen and Chickens,&quot;
  where poor &quot;Walter&quot; always brought him, without waiting for
  an order, what Tony Weller called the &quot;inwariable&quot; and a
  choice cigar. He did not talk much, but, when he spoke, he had always
  &quot;something to say.&quot; He left early, and went from there,
  almost nightly, to the Theatre Royal, where he occupied, invariably,
  a back seat of a certain box, and here, if the performances were a
  little dull, he would often enjoy a comfortable nap.</p>

  <p>In private life he was cheerful, easily pleased, and unaffected.
  He was greatly beloved by children and young people. I wrote the
  other day to a lady, at whose father&#39;s house he was a frequent
  visitor, asking for her recollections of him; and the reply is so
  pleasant and graphic, that, without her permission, I shall quote it
  verbatim:</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
  <p>&quot;When he dined with papa it was always a
  &#39;gentlemen&#39;s&#39; party, and only mamma dined with them. We
  used to see the visitors at dessert only. I remember Mr. Gillott as
  always being very cheery in manner, with a kind smile; and few words.
  As children, when we went to dancing parties at his house, he would
  come during the evening, with a few old friends (the fathers of the
  children assembled), and, standing in the door of the drawing-room,
  pat the children on the head and have a little joke with them as they
  passed him. He would stay for about half-an-hour or so, and then
  return with his friends down-stairs to smoke. I have heard papa, who,
  as you know, was no mean judge, say what a remarkably quick ear Mr.
  Gillott had for music. When they had been together to hear a new
  opera, he, on his return home, would whistle correctly the greater
  portion of the music, having only heard it once.&quot;</p>
  </div>

  <p>Personally, Mr. Gillott was rather short, and was of broad and
  sturdy build. He had a remarkably firm step, and there was a rhythmic
  regularity in his footfall. He was fond of light attire, and
  generally wore a white hat. There was an air of freshness in his
  appearance that was very pleasant, and he had such a remarkably clean
  look that I have often thought that <i>his</i> cleanliness was
  something <i>positive</i>, something more than the mere absence of
  dirt. He had a curious way, as he walked, of looking dreamily upon
  the ground a few yards in front of him, and when anyone met him his
  eye would rise with a kind of jerk; then with a piercing glance he
  would intently, for a moment only, &quot;take stock&quot; of the
  passer by, and drop his eyes again.</p>

  <p>For the last two or three years of his life he was haunted by a
  fear of impending blindness. The thought of being shut out from the
  sight of his pictures caused him much gloomy apprehension. Happily,
  his fears were not realised. He retained his sight and other
  faculties unimpaired until his death. On the 26th of December, 1872,
  he, in accordance with his annual Christmas custom, assembled all his
  family to dinner, at his house in Westbourne Road, and in his kindly,
  affectionate manner spoke hopefully of meeting them there on the same
  day of the following year. It was not to be. On the next day he felt
  somewhat unwell; in two or three days bronchitis and pleurisy
  supervened; and in the afternoon of Friday, the 5th of January, 1873,
  his long, honourable, and useful life terminated.</p><a name=

  <h2>HENRY VAN WART, J.P.</h2>

  <p>Many years ago I was one of a small dinner party of gentlemen at a
  house in the Hagley Road. I was a comparative stranger, for I only
  knew the host and two others who were there. I was a young man, and
  all the other guests were men of middle age. The party had been
  invited for the purpose of introducing me to &quot;a few old
  friends,&quot; and I was to be married the next day to a relative of
  the host. Sitting opposite to me at table was a gentleman of some
  fifty or sixty years of age, whose fine oval face and ample brow
  struck me as having the most benevolent and &quot;fatherly&quot;
  expression I had ever seen. The custom had not then quite died out of
  toasting the guests at dinner parties, and upon a hint from the host
  this gentleman rose, and in simple and apparently sincere phrase,
  proposed to the company to drink my health. I mention it now, because
  I remember in what a kindly, genial way he pointed out to me the
  course of conduct best calculated to secure happiness in the state
  into which I was so soon to enter. I recollect, too, how his voice
  faltered as he spoke of his own long and happy experience as a
  husband and a father, and mentioned that in one great trouble of his
  life it was the loving support of his wife that enabled him to bear,
  and eventually to overcome it. The speaker was Henry Van Wart.</p>

  <p>I suppose the impressionable state of my own mind at the time,
  made me peculiarly susceptible to external influences, and fixed
  minute circumstances more intensely on my memory; so that I now
  vividly recall the thought which then occurred to me&#8212;that I had
  never before seen so much gentleness and calm quiet benignity in a
  <i>man</i>. The impression then rapidly formed has lasted ever since,
  for in all the long years from that day until his death I never had
  cause to abate one jot of the reverential feeling with which he then
  inspired me. I have had hundreds of business transactions with his
  house; I have seen him often in the magistrate&#39;s chair; and I
  have met him publicly and privately, and he had always the same
  bland, suave, courteous, and kindly bearing. Strength of character
  and gentleness of conduct and manner were so combined in him that he
  frequently seemed to me to be a living proof of the truth of a saying
  of poor George Dawson: &quot;The tenderness of a strong man is more
  gentle than the gentleness of the most tender woman.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mr. Van Wart was an American by birth, and a Dutchman by descent.
  His ancestors emigrated from Holland about the year 1630 to the
  colony of New Netherland, established in North America by the Dutch
  in the year 1621. The capital of this settlement was named New
  Amsterdam, and was built upon the island of Manhattan, the entire
  area of which, now completely covered with buildings, and comprising
  the whole site of the city of New York, had been bought from an
  Iroquois chief, in fee-simple, for twenty-four dollars, being at
  about the rate of a penny for twelve acres! In 1652, New Amsterdam,
  then having about a thousand inhabitants, was incorporated as a city.
  Twelve years after, the entire province was seized by the British,
  under Colonel Nichols, and was re-named by him &quot;New York.&quot;
  The Dutch made some unsuccessful attempts to recover possession, and
  they held the city for a short time, but in 1674 the whole colony was
  ceded by treaty to the English, who held it until the War of
  Independence. When they quitted it, on November 25th, 1783, Henry Van
  Wart was exactly two months old.</p>

  <p>The struggle for the independence of the American states had been
  going on with varying success for many years, but the tide at length
  turned so decidedly against the British, that an armistice was sought
  and agreed upon. Hostilities were suspended, and a conference met in
  Paris. Here a treaty, acknowledging the independence of America, was
  agreed to by England, and signed on the 3rd of September, 1783. On
  the 25th of the same month, Henry Van Wart was born at a pretty
  village on the banks of the Hudson, called Tarrytown, a place since
  celebrated as the &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; of Washington
  Irving&#39;s delightful book, but at that time remarkable as the
  scene of one of the most distressing incidents in all the wretched
  struggle then just over&#8212;the capture of the unfortunate Major
  André.</p>

  <p>Mr. Van Wart, feeling little inclination for his father&#39;s
  business of a farmer, was apprenticed to the mercantile firm of
  Irving and Smith, of New York. In accordance with the usage of the
  times, he became an inmate of the household of Mr. William Irving,
  the head of the firm. Mr. Irving, like his gifted brother,
  Washington, was a man of extensive reading and considerable taste,
  culture, and refinement. Mr. Van Wart&#39;s intercourse with the
  Irving family, had, no doubt, a considerable influence in forming his
  character. He probably learned from them the courtesy and kindness of
  manner which distinguished him through life.</p>

  <p>On the termination of his apprenticeship in the year 1804, Mr. Van
  Wart married the youngest sister of his employer, and was despatched
  by the firm, who had unbounded confidence in his integrity and
  judgment, to organise a branch of the house at Liverpool. Here his
  eldest son, Henry, was born in 1806, soon after which the Liverpool
  concern was abandoned, and Mr. Van Wart returned to America, where he
  remained for some considerable period.</p>

  <p>Soon after the birth of his second son, Irving, in 1808, Mr. Van
  Wart returned to England with his family, and commenced business in
  Birmingham. He first occupied a house on the left-hand side of the
  West Bromwich road, at Handsworth. The house, which is occupied by
  Mr. T.R.T. Hodgson, is a stuccoed one, with its gable towards the
  road; it stands near the &quot;New Inn.&quot; After a short time he
  removed to the house at the corner of Newhall Street and Great
  Charles Street, which was, until recently, occupied by the
  Institution of Mechanical Engineers.</p>

  <p>He afterwards bought a stone-built house in Icknield Street West.
  This house stood on the right-hand side near the present Wesleyan
  Chapel. It is now pulled down. In connection with this purchase, a
  curious circumstance occurred. As already stated, Mr. Van Wart was
  born a few days after England had acknowledged the independence of
  America. Those few days made all the difference to him. Had his birth
  occurred a month earlier, he would have been born a British subject.
  As it was, he was an alien, and incapable of holding freehold
  property in England. To get over this difficulty, he had to apply
  for, and obtain, a special Act of Parliament to naturalise him. This
  having passed, he was enabled to complete the purchase of the house,
  to which he soon removed. Here his celebrated brother-in-law,
  Washington Irving, came on a visit, and in this house the greater
  part of the &quot;Sketch-book&quot; was written.</p>

  <p>In 1814, the second American War was closed by treaty, and all the
  world was at peace. Business on both sides of the Atlantic became
  suddenly inflated, and there being at that time no restriction upon
  the issue of bank notes, mercantile transactions, to enormous
  amounts, were comparatively easy. Urged by American buyers, Mr. Van
  Wart purchased very large quantities of Birmingham and other goods,
  which he shipped to New York. In a very short time, however, a
  revulsion came. Prices fell rapidly, in some cases to the extent of
  50 per cent; American houses by scores tottered and fell; the Irvings
  could not weather the storm, and their fall brought down Mr. Van
  Wart.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was honourably released from his difficulties, he
  commenced another kind of business. He no longer sent his own goods
  for sale abroad, but bought exclusively on commission for other
  merchants. This business rapidly grew into one of the most extensive
  and important in Birmingham; was continued by him until the day of
  his death, and is still in active operation.</p>

  <p>Having sold his house at Springfield to Mr. Barker, the Solicitor,
  he removed to a house at the top of Newhall Hill, then quite in the
  country: This house is still standing, but is incorporated with Mr.
  Wiley&#39;s manufactory, and is entirely hidden from view by the
  lofty buildings which have enclosed it. From here, about 1820, he
  removed to Calthorpe Road, then newly formed, where he occupied a
  house&#8212;the seventh, I think&#8212;on the left-hand from the Five
  Ways. From the back windows of this house he could look across fields
  and meadows to Moseley, there not being, with the exception of a few
  in the Bristol Road, a house or other building visible. Here
  Washington Irving was almost a constant visitor. Here
  &quot;Bracebridge Hall&quot;&#8212;the original of which was Aston
  Hall&#8212;was written, and in this house some of the most delightful
  letters published in Irving&#39;s biography were penned. After a few
  years, Mr. Van Wart finally removed to &quot;The Shrubbery&quot; in
  Hagley Road, where he continued to reside until his death.</p>

  <p>After the death of his excellent wife, which occurred in 1848, he
  went on a long visit to America, and while there narrowly escaped
  death. He was proceeding from Boston to New York, up Long Island
  Sound, when a storm arose, and the vessel was wrecked upon the
  Connecticut shore. She lay some fifty yards from the land; some of
  the passengers got on shore something as St. Paul did upon the island
  of Melita. Mr. Van Wart, deeming it safer to hold to the wreck,
  remained until he was getting benumbed, and feared losing the use of
  his limbs. Letting himself down into the water, he paddled and swam
  amongst the broken stuff from the ship until he reached the shore. He
  was, however, too much exhausted to get upon the land, but some one,
  who had observed his struggles, dragged him, quite insensible, from
  the water. He was carried on men&#39;s backs some half a mile, to a
  farm house, where he was hospitably treated, and nursed until he
  recovered.</p>

  <p>The character of a man who had so little of the &quot;light and
  shade&quot; of average humanity, and the placid current of whose life
  seemed so unrippled, offers none of those strong contrasts, and
  subtle peculiarities, which render the analysis of more stormy and
  unequal minds comparatively easy. His frank and open speech; the
  kindly grasp of his hand; his ever-ready ear for tales of trouble or
  difficulty; the wise counsel, which was never withheld; the general
  bland and suave manner; the pleasant smile, and his remarkably
  genial, hearty greeting, will be long remembered, and they make it
  difficult to say anything of him, except in panegyric.</p>

  <p>There is one point, however, on which a word or two may be said,
  as I think he has been somewhat misunderstood. It has been said of
  him that he was &quot;incapable of strong friendly attachments.&quot;
  I am of opinion that this impression may have been caused by his very
  genial manner and hearty bearing. These may have led some to think
  that he felt towards them as a friend in the highest sense, while
  <i>he</i> looked upon <i>them</i> merely as acquaintances. His
  friendliness was general and diffusive, and certainly was not
  concentrated upon one or two objects, as is the case sometimes with
  intenser natures. That he <i>was</i> capable of lasting friendship,
  however, one little circumstance will show. Mr. S.D. Williams, of the
  Reservoir Road, one of the most intellectual men of whom Birmingham
  could boast, was an invalid for a very long time before his death,
  and, I believe, had not been outside his own gates for nearly thirty
  years. During the whole of that long time, up to within a few weeks
  of his death, Mr. Van Wart never missed paying him a visit every
  Saturday evening. On these occasions they invariably played whist, a
  game of which Mr. Van Wart, being a particularly skilful player, was
  remarkably fond. His punctuality in this matter was something
  remarkable; at eight o&#39;clock to the minute he arrived, and at
  five minutes to twelve exactly his coachman brought the carriage to
  take his master home.</p>

  <p>As a merchant, he was intelligent, sagacious, straight-forward,
  methodical, and strictly honourable; and his cordial manner made him
  a universal favourite both among manufacturers and customers. He was
  much beloved by his clerks and assistants, many of whom grew gray in
  his service. He was American Vice-Consul for a time, but from his
  first coming to England does not seem to have taken any great
  interest in American politics. During the Civil War in the States,
  although his sympathies were altogether with the North, he took no
  public part in the dispute, standing in strong contrast to his
  countryman and fellow townsman, Mr. Goddard, who wrote voluminously,
  and whose writings had a very marked effect upon the public opinion
  of England on that great question. As an English politician, Mr. Van
  Wart was neither very active nor very ardent. He was a Liberal, but
  inclined to Whig views. He opposed Mr. Bright in his first contested
  election for Birmingham, but there is reason for thinking he
  regretted it afterwards.</p>

  <p>When the town was incorporated, in 1838, he was chosen to be one
  of the Councillors for Edgbaston Ward, and on the first meeting of
  the Council, was elected Alderman, an office he held for twenty
  years. He might have been Mayor at any time, but he invariably
  declined that honour. He was one of the first creation of Borough
  Magistrates, and he conscientiously fulfilled the duties of that
  office until near his end, when increasing deafness rendered him
  incapable.</p>

  <p>In private life he was greatly beloved. Those who had the pleasure
  of the acquaintance of Mrs. Van Wart say that he always treated her
  with remarkable deference and consideration, &quot;as if she were a
  superior being.&quot; His intercourse with his gifted brother-in-law,
  Washington Irving, seems to have been of the most close and
  affectionate character. His presence at an evening party was always
  greeted with a hearty welcome, up to the latest period of his life;
  and it was pleasant to see, when he was verging upon his 90th year,
  how young ladies seemed as desirous to meet his kindly glance as
  their great-grandmothers may have been sixty years before.</p>

  <p>Up to a year or two before his death, his robust constitution; his
  quiet, regular habits; his equanimity of disposition, and his
  temperate method of life, preserved his strength and vigour almost
  unimpaired. Few can forget his hale and hearty presence, as he strode
  along the streets of Birmingham; his peculiar walk&#8212;the strange
  jerky spring of the hinder foot, and the heavy planting of the front,
  as if he were striking the earth with a powerful blow&#8212;marking
  his individuality, whilst the pleasant kindly smile of greeting, and
  the full firm tones of his manly voice, gave evidence of vigour very
  rare in a man of his age. Even to the last his strength seemed
  unimpaired, and he succumbed to a chance attack of bronchitis, but
  for which his constitution seemed to possess sufficient stamina to
  have made him a centenarian. He died at his residence on the 15th of
  February, 1873, being then in his 90th year.</p>

  <p>He was a well-informed man, and had a most retentive memory. He
  had a great fund of quiet humour, and could tell a good story better
  than most men. He was a good judge of character, and, as a
  magistrate, could distinguish between what was radically bad in a
  prisoner, and the crime which was the outcome of want and
  wretchedness. During his long Birmingham life of nearly seventy
  years, he was universally respected, and when he descended into the
  grave it may be said that there was no one who could say of him an
  unkindly word.</p>

  <p>He was mainly instrumental in the establishment of the Birmingham
  Exchange, the idea of which originated with Mr. Edwin Lander. He
  exerted himself greatly in the establishment of the company which
  erected the buildings, and he was its chairman until his death. The
  members of this institution, to mark their sense of his worth,
  commissioned Mr. Munns to paint his portrait; and if any reader is
  desirous to see the &quot;counterfeit presentment&quot; of what Henry
  Van Wart was, he has only to enter the principal hall of the
  Exchange, where he will find a full-length portrait, at 87 years of
  age, of a man who, more than any other I have known, was entitled
  to&#8212;</p>

  <h2>CHARLES SHAW, J.P., &amp;c.</h2>

  <p>Just before the Great Western Railway Company began the
  construction of their line from Oxford to Birmingham, I was passing
  down Great Charles Street one afternoon, when my attention was
  attracted by some unusual bustle. Near the spot where the hideous
  railway bridge now disfigures the street, there was a row of carts
  and vans backed up to the curbstone of the pavement on the left. From
  a passage by the side of a large square brick-built house some
  brokers&#39; men were bringing a variety of dingy stools, desks,
  shelves, counters, and other odds and ends of office furniture. Near
  the front door of the house, stood, looking on, a well-dressed,
  stout-built, florid-complexioned man, of middle height, and,
  apparently, of middle age. As I slackened my pace to observe more
  intently the operations of the brokers&#39; men, this gentleman
  approached me, and in courteous tones, and as if appealing to me for
  sympathy, said, &quot;You can&#39;t imagine the pain these
  proceedings are giving me; I was born in this house more than fifty
  years ago; I have never been away from it long together; I&#39;ve
  been familiar, all my life, with the &#39;things&#39; they are
  carting away, and to see the old place stripped in this way, hurts me
  as much as if I were having one of my limbs cut off.&quot; As he
  spoke, his voice became tremulous, and tears&#8212;actual
  tears&#8212;rolled down his cheeks. I was amazed; I was completely
  thunder-struck. The man who thus spoke, and who then shed tears, was,
  of all men in the world, the very last I should have thought capable
  of a tender emotion, or of a sentimental feeling about a lot of
  worn-out stools and tables. He was generally considered to be the
  <i>hardest</i> man in Birmingham, and that this man should be capable
  of sentimentalism, even to tears, was a mystery to me then, and will
  be a surprise to most of those who only knew the man superficially.
  He was no other than Charles&#8212;or, as he was universally called,
  &quot;Charley&quot;&#8212;Shaw. The railway company, requiring the
  site of his business premises for the construction of their line, had
  bought the place, and an auction sale that day had disposed of the
  well-worn effects that were being carted away.</p>

  <p>Probably no Birmingham man occupying a prominent position, was
  ever so unpopular as Charles Shaw. He was generally disliked and
  somewhat dreaded. He was unscrupulous and regardless of truth, where
  truthfulness and his interests were antagonistic. His manners,
  frequently, went far beyond the limit of decent behaviour. I hope,
  however, spite of his many failings, to show, in the course of this
  sketch, that he had many redeeming qualities; that he was a most
  useful citizen; and that he was not altogether so black as he was
  painted.</p>

  <p>He certainly was a strange mixture of good and bad qualities. He
  seemed to be made up altogether of opposites. He was very bitter
  against any one who had offended him, yet he was not permanently
  vindictive. He was grasping in business, yet he was not ungenerous.
  He was a most implacable enemy, yes he was capable of warm and most
  disinterested friendship. He could descend to trickery in dealing,
  yet as a magistrate he had a high and most inflexible ideal of
  honour, honesty, and rectitude. He could be coarse in his conduct and
  demeanour, and yet he could occasionally be as courteous and
  dignified as the most polished gentleman. He was overbearing where he
  felt he was safe, yet where he was met by courage and firmness he
  yielded quietly and quickly.</p>

  <p>My own introduction, and subsequent acquaintance, were strangely
  characteristic of the peculiarly antithetic nature of the man. They
  began in ill-temper, and resulted in commercial relations of a most
  friendly nature, extending over many years, without a second unkindly
  word. The first time I saw him occurred one day when I was making a
  round of calls upon the merchants of the town, to exhibit a case of
  samples of goods of my own manufacture, and I called upon Mr. Shaw.
  Going up the passage I have mentioned above, and climbing a rickety
  stair, I found myself in a room containing a couple of clerks. Upon
  my inquiring for Mr. Shaw, one of them went into another room to
  fetch him, and I took the opportunity to note the peculiarities of
  the place. It was a long room with a sloping ceiling; there were two
  or three very old, ink-stained, worm-eaten desks; a dingy map hung
  here and there, and a few shelves and wooden presses were arranged
  upon the walls. The place had been whitewashed once, no doubt, but
  the colour was now about the same as that of a macadamised road, and
  the whole place seemed dirty and neglected.</p>

  <p>Presently Mr. Shaw appeared. I had heard his character pretty
  freely discussed, and I was prepared for a rough reception. He looked
  at my samples, and inquired very minutely into the prices of each. As
  to one article, which I quoted to him at fifteen shillings the gross,
  I said that in that particular item I believed my price was lower
  than that of any other maker. He said nothing, but left me, went back
  to his private office, returned with a file of papers, and selecting
  one, addressed me in angry tones, saying, &quot;Now, just to show you
  what a <i>blessed</i> fool you are, you shall see an invoice of those
  very goods, which I have just bought at fourteen shillings.&quot; I
  was mistaken, that was very clear; but I said, &quot;It appears that
  I am wrong as to those, but here are other goods which no one but
  myself is making; can we do business in these?&quot; This put him in
  a violent rage, for he stormed as he said, &quot;No! You&#39;ve made
  a <i>consummate</i> fool of yourself by making such a stupid remark.
  I&#39;ve no confidence in you; and where I&#39;ve no confidence
  I&#39;ll never do business.&quot; By this time I was getting a little
  warm myself, and as I fastened up my case of patterns, I said,
  &quot;I hope, Mr. Shaw, that the want of your confidence won&#39;t be
  the death of me. I always heard you were a queer fellow; but if you
  generally treat people who call upon you on business in the way you
  have treated me, I&#39;m not at all surprised at the name you have in
  the town.&quot; He looked at me furiously; came two or three strides
  towards me, as if he would strike me; but, stopping suddenly, said,
  &quot;I think you&#39;d better be off.&quot; &quot;I quite agree with
  you, sir,&quot; I replied; &quot;it&#39;s no use my stopping here to
  be insulted.&quot; Upon this he returned to his private office; the
  two clerks, who, during the &quot;shindy,&quot; had been intently
  searching inside their desks for something they had lost, now put
  down the lids, and, looking at each other, grinned and tittered
  openly, while I, to their intense relief, took up my hat and
  departed.</p>

  <p>Two or three weeks subsequently, I had completed an article in my
  business which was strikingly novel, and I went out to show a sample
  of it to my customers. Passing Mr. Shaw&#39;s warehouse, the thought
  occurred to me that it would be good fun to call upon him again, and
  I accordingly soon found myself on the scene of the former interview.
  Mr. Shaw was there, and to my bold greeting, &quot;Good morning, Mr.
  Shaw,&quot; made a sulky-sounding acknowledgment. I went
  on&#8212;&quot;I was here the other day, and you told me you had no
  confidence in me; but I&#39;ve plenty of confidence in myself, and so
  I&#39;ve come again.&quot; This seemed to amuse him, and he asked,
  &quot;Well, what is it?&quot; I then showed him the sample article,
  and told him the price was thirty-six shillings the gross. He looked
  at it attentively, and said, &quot;H&#39;m! Costs you about
  eighteen.&quot; I was in a bantering humour, and I replied, &quot;No,
  I don&#39;t think it costs me more than twelve; but I don&#39;t mean
  to sell any under thirty-six.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said he,
  &quot;it&#39;s a very good thing. Send me ten gross.&quot; From that
  moment we were excellent friends; I did business with him for many
  years, and our intercourse was always warm and friendly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Shaw&#39;s father was originally a working maker of
  currycombs, an article, before his day, entirely made by hand. In
  conjunction with his brother, he invented and took out a patent for
  cutting out and shaping the various parts by machinery, and so
  producing the entire article much more cheaply than before. It was a
  great success; they readily sold as many as they could produce, and
  their profit was enormous; it has been estimated by a competent judge
  to have been as high as two hundred per cent. They soon became rich,
  and established themselves as home and foreign merchants, and when
  they died, left, for that period, very large fortunes. They were both
  men of ability, but of no education, and they retained to the last
  the coarse, habits of their early life. Mr. Charles Shaw, the subject
  of this sketch, was brought up in the factory, his daily associates
  being the working people of the place. Having himself no
  <i>innate</i> refinement, the want of good examples, and the
  prevalence of bad ones, at this period of his life, had a permanent
  effect upon his habits and manners, which in all his after prosperity
  he could never shake off. Had he been liberally educated, and in
  early life had associated with gentlemen, he might have risen to be
  one of the leading men of the nation. He had enormous energy and
  great powers of steady, plodding perseverance. He had great influence
  over others, and his disposition, and capability to lead and to
  command, were sufficient, had they been properly trained and
  directed, to have carried him to a front rank in life. His early
  disadvantages prevented him from becoming other than a
  &quot;local&quot; celebrity; but, even circumscribed as he was, he
  was a very remarkable instance of the combined effects of energy and
  method. He amassed a very large fortune, and left in full and active
  operation several very important trading concerns. Besides his
  various branches of foreign commerce, he was a manufacturer of
  currycombs, iron and brass candlesticks, frying pans, fenders, cast
  and cut nails, and various other goods; and, upon the whole, he may
  be said to have been the most active and efficient merchant and
  manufacturer, of his generation, in the Midland Counties.</p>

  <p>In politics he was one of the very last of the old school of
  Tories, and he occasionally acted as a leader of his party in the
  town. His extreme opinions, and his blunt speech in relation to these
  matters, frequently got him into &quot;hot water.&quot; He was not a
  &quot;newspaper politician,&quot; for, singularly enough, he was
  rarely seen to look at a newspaper, even at the news-room (then
  standing on the site now occupied by the Inland Revenue Offices, on
  Bennetts Hill), which he regularly frequented. Upon political topics,
  I am not aware that he ever wrote a single line for publication in
  his whole life.</p>

  <p>Mr. Shaw was very generous to people for whom he had a liking. He
  has assisted many scores of struggling men with heavy sums, on loan,
  merely out of friendship. I happen to know of one case where he, for
  fifteen or twenty years, continuously assisted a brother merchant, to
  the tune of £10,000 to £15,000, on merely nominal security, for which
  assistance he, for the most part, charged nothing whatever.</p>

  <p>In the great panic of 1837, Mr. Shaw, singly, saved the country
  from ruin and disaster. At the time when the panic was at its height,
  and the tension was as great as the country could bear, it became
  known to a few that one of the great financial houses in Liverpool
  was in extremities. They had accepted on American account to enormous
  amounts, and no remittances were forthcoming. One Birmingham bank
  alone held £90,000 worth of their paper, and acceptances to enormous
  amounts were held in London, and in every manufacturing centre in
  England, Ireland, and Scotland. Application had been made to the Bank
  of England for assistance, to the amount of a million and a quarter,
  and had been refused. Ruin seemed imminent, not only to the house
  itself, but to the whole country. The calamities of 1825 seemed about
  to be repeated, and alarm was universal. Mr. Shaw took up the matter
  with his usual skill and wonderful energy. He went to London, and had
  three interviews with the Governor of the Bank of England and the
  Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8212;Mr. Francis Baring&#8212;in one
  day. He told them that they had no choice; that they <i>must</i>
  grant the required relief; that to refuse would be equivalent to a
  revolution, and would involve national loss to probably fifty times
  the amount now required. He undertook to obtain security to a large
  amount in Birmingham alone. Only the other day I had in my hand a
  bill for £8,000, given by one Birmingham merchant, as a portion of
  this security. He succeeded. The relief was granted. The house
  recovered its position, and still holds on its prosperous way; but,
  except the consciousness of well-doing, Mr. Shaw had no reward. The
  pecuniary value of his services to his country in this extremity it
  is impossible to estimate; it is enough to say here that they
  out-weighed, and cast into the shade, his many personal faults and
  weaknesses. I have always thought, and still think, that the
  Government ought at least to have knighted him, as only a very slight
  acknowledgment of the invaluable and peculiar service he had rendered
  to the nation.</p>

  <p>Almost everybody knows that Mr. Shaw was, for many years, chairman
  of the <i>old</i> Birmingham Banking Company. In this capacity he was
  no doubt the means of introducing a large amount of profitable
  business. Unfortunately for the company, the manager of the branch
  establishment at Dudley made enormous advances to an ironmaster in
  that locality. The amount at length became so large that the
  directorate became alarmed, and deputed their chairman, Mr. Shaw, to
  see what could best be done for the interests of the bank. Mr. Shaw
  took the matter in hand. There was a good deal of secrecy about his
  manner of treating the matter, and eventually some of his colleagues
  on the direction were suspicious that he was making use of his
  position in the bank for his own advantage. He was called upon to
  show his private account with the concern in question, to which he
  gave an unqualified refusal. His colleagues intimated to him that he
  must either do so or resign. The next post brought his resignation.
  Offering no opinion either way, but looking at the transaction as an
  outsider, I think it was an unfortunate business &quot;all
  round.&quot; The bank lost money, and eventually collapsed, but I
  fully believed then, and I always shall believe, that if Charles Shaw
  had been at the helm, the bank never would have closed its doors. I
  believe he had energy enough, and influence sufficient, to have
  averted that great calamity; and I am firmly of opinion that the
  company had sufficient vitality to have overcome the drain upon its
  resources, and that it might at this moment have been in vigorous
  existence.</p>

  <p>Many amusing stories are current as to Mr. Shaw&#39;s shrewd and
  keen transactions, and of cases where he himself was overreached. One
  of the best of these he used to tell with much humour.</p>

  <p>When the Great Western Company cut through Birmingham, for their
  line to the North, a cemetery, pretty well filled, was on the route
  they selected. It was the Quakers&#39; burial place, adjoining
  Monmouth Street, exactly where the Arcade commences. Mr. Shaw, being
  a director, negotiated the purchase of many Birmingham properties.
  This burial ground was one, and the Quaker community had for their
  agent a very shrewd spokesman. Shaw and he had a very tough fight,
  for the Quaker drove a hard bargain. At length terms were settled,
  and a memorandum signed. The negotiations had then lasted so long,
  that the contractors were waiting for this plot of land to go on with
  the work. Mr. Shaw therefore asked for immediate possession.
  &quot;Oh, no, friend Shaw,&quot; said the Quaker, &quot;not until the
  money&#39;s paid.&quot; This caused further delay, and annoyed Shaw.
  Preliminary matters being settled, the money was eventually handed
  over, and Shaw obtained the keys. The next day the Quaker appeared
  and said, &quot;Now, friend Shaw, as everything is settled, I am come
  to arrange for the removal of the remains of our friends who are
  buried there.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t you wish you may get it?&quot;
  said Shaw; &quot;we&#39;ve bought the freehold; all it contains is
  our property, and we shall give up nothing.&quot; This was a
  surprise, indeed, for the Quaker. He had nothing to say as to the
  position Shaw had taken up, and he had to submit to the modification
  of many stringent conditions in the deed of sale, before Shaw would
  give way.</p>

  <p>Such, sketched in a hasty manner, is an attempt to portray the
  apparently contradictory character of Charles Shaw. It may be a
  failure; but it, at least, is an honest endeavour. Such men are rare,
  and the ability to translate into words their peculiar mental
  workings is rarer still. I, however, shall be bold to say that if few
  Birmingham men have had so many failings, none probably have
  possessed so much commercial courage and ability.</p>

  <p>Soon after his retirement from the Board of the Birmingham Bank,
  he had a slight attack of paralysis, from which he never properly
  recovered. Others followed at intervals, with the result that his
  fine physique was completely broken up. In the first week of
  December, 1864, I spoke to him on the platform of the Great Western
  Railway at Snow Hill. He was being half carried to the train, on his
  way to the sea-side. He never returned to Birmingham, but died at
  Brighton, January 4th, 1865, being 73 years of age. He was buried in
  the Churchyard of St. George&#39;s, Great Hampton Row.</p>

  <h2>ROBERT WALTER WINFIELD, J.P.</h2>

  <p>Mr. Joshua Scholefield, who had represented Birmingham from its
  incorporation in 1832, having been elected five times, died somewhat
  unexpectedly in July, 1844. The Liberal party in the town was then in
  a somewhat disorganised condition, and there was considerable
  difference of opinion as to the choice of his successor. A large
  majority was disposed favourably towards his son, Mr. William
  Scholefield. The more advanced section of the party was of opinion
  that the many services of Mr. Joseph Sturge to the Liberal cause were
  such as to entitle him to a place in Parliament. Neither section of
  the party would give way. The Conservatives, who had previously
  contested four elections unsuccessfully, in two of which Mr. Richard
  Spooner had been the candidate, saw that the divided ranks of their
  opponents gave them a better chance of success than they had
  previously had, and they brought forward Mr. Spooner again. This time
  he was successful, the result of the poll being that Mr. Spooner
  received 2,095 votes; Mr. W. Scholefield, 1,735; and Mr. Sturge,
  346.</p>

  <p>I was living in London at the time, but had arranged to spend a
  few days in August with a friend at Edgbaston. He was a Conservative,
  and I a Liberal; but before I came down he had taken a ticket in my
  name, which entitled me to be present at the only purely Conservative
  dinner at which I was ever present. It was given at the Racket Court
  Inn, in Sheepcote Street, by the Conservative electors of Ladywood
  Ward, to celebrate Mr. Spooner&#39;s return.</p><a name="image-0002"

  <p>By virtue of my introduction, and in deference to me as a
  stranger, I was placed near the chairman at table. He was a man of
  singularly bland and kindly manners, and there was a frank and manly
  modesty in his style that attracted my notice at once. In simple but
  appropriate, in unaffected yet dignified, phraseology, he went
  through the usual &quot;loyal and patriotic&quot; toasts. When it
  came to the toast of the day, he rose and congratulated the company
  upon the triumph of those principles which they all conscientiously
  believed to be right and true. There was no exultation over a
  discomfited foe. There ran all through the speech a benevolent and
  friendly feeling for both of the defeated candidates. Still, there
  was the outspoken feeling of intense gratification that the cause
  which he supported had been victorious. I have seldom listened to a
  speech where joy for a victory was so little mixed with exultation
  over the vanquished. In fact, although I differed altogether from the
  speaker in politics, I felt that the speech was that of a man devoid
  of all bitterness, whose kindness of spirit led him to rejoice, not
  over the defeat of his opponents, but at the success of his own
  cause. Tie speech was in excellent taste from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>The chairman was Robert Walter Winfield, and this was the first
  time I had met him. His singular courtesy to myself, as a stranger, I
  shall never forget. His perfect self-possession, when some of the
  company became a little too demonstrative, kept the table in perfect
  order. When he retired, my friend took his seat, and slily poured me
  a glass from Mr. Winfield&#39;s decanter. I found then, that during
  that long afternoon he had taken nothing but toast and water, which
  had been prepared to resemble sherry, and which he had taken from a
  wine-glass as if it were wine.</p>

  <p>I cannot say that I ever became very intimate with Mr. Winfield,
  although we knew each other pretty well; but limited as my means of
  acquaintanceship were, I watched his life with interest, because he
  struck me always as being one of the very few men I have known, who
  have been able to bear great success without becoming giddy with the
  elevation; who have gone through life modestly and without
  assumption; and who have won thereby the esteem of all those whose
  esteem has been worth caring for.</p>

  <p>Robert Walter Winfield was descended from an ancient family, which
  had been settled in Leicestershire for several generations. His
  grandfather, Edward Winfield, came to Birmingham about the middle of
  the last century, and resided in a large house, on the site of the
  Great Western Railway Station in Snow Hill. Here Mr. Winfield&#39;s
  father was born. He was a man of independent means, but appears for
  some short time to have been engaged as a merchant. He married a lady
  from Loughborough, named Randon, and built for his own occupation the
  house in the Hagley Road, Edgbaston, now occupied by Mr. Alfred Hill,
  the son of the late eminent Recorder of Birmingham, Matthew Davenport
  Hill. The house is now called &quot;Davenport House.&quot; It was, I
  believe, the first house erected on the Calthorpe estate. In this
  house, in April, 1799, Robert Walter Winfield, the third son, was
  born. His father died in his childhood. After his education was
  complete, his mother placed him with Mr. Benjamin Cooke, whose name
  as a manufacturer is still remembered in Birmingham. Mr.
  Winfield&#39;s mind, being a peculiarly receptive one, readily
  grasped all the details of the business, and he soon wished to enter
  life on his own account. His trustees having great faith in his
  prudence and industry, advanced him the necessary capital, and he
  commenced business before he was twenty-one years of age. Just at the
  bend which Cambridge Street takes to arrive at the Crescent, there is
  a stuccoed building, almost hidden by the lofty piles around it. In
  this building he started on his commercial career, and in these works
  he continued to carry on his business until his death, some fifty
  years afterwards.</p>

  <p>Beginning in a comparatively small way, he started with a strict
  determination to conduct his business upon thoroughly honest and
  truthful principles. He had the sagacity to see that the surest way
  to success was to gain the confidence of his customers, and he firmly
  held through life to the system of rigid adherence to truth; to the
  plan of always making <i>honest</i> goods; and to the avoidance of
  every kind of misrepresentation as to the quality of his wares. He
  used to say that all through his long and successful business career
  he never lost a customer through misrepresentation on his part, and
  that he generally found that one transaction with a fresh man secured
  a permanent customer.</p>

  <p>Another leading principle in his business programme was to employ
  the best workmen he could find, and the highest talent for superior
  offices he could secure. He probably paid higher wages and salaries
  than any manufacturer in the district. This proved to be wise economy
  in the long-run, for his goods became famous for excellence in design
  and workmanship, and were sought and prized in every market of the
  world.</p>

  <p>As his business fame increased, the development of his trade
  became enormous. Pile after pile of extensive blocks of buildings
  rose, one after another, on ground adjoining the original
  manufactory, until at length the entire establishment covered many
  acres of ground. Many of these buildings were five or six storeys
  high. The machinery and tools were all of the very best quality that
  could be obtained, and use was invariably made of every suitable
  scientific appliance as soon as discovered. For many years Mr.
  Aitken, whose name in Birmingham will always be remembered in
  connection with Art, was at the head of the designing department of
  the works. His correct knowledge and wonderful skill in the
  application of correct principles of form and colour to articles of
  manufacture for daily use, raised the fame of Mr. Winfield&#39;s
  house as high, artistically, as it was for excellence of material and
  workmanship.</p>

  <p>Mr. Winfield was one of the first, if not the very earliest, to
  apply the stamping process to the production of cornices,
  cornice-pole ends, curtain bands, and other similar goods. The
  singular purity of colour which, by skilful &quot;dipping&quot; and
  lacquering, he was able to produce, at a period when such matters
  were little attended to, secured for his goods a good deal of
  admiration and a ready sale. At the time of the great Exhibition of
  1851, the goods he exhibited obtained for him the highest mark of
  approval&#8212;the Council Gold Medal. The Jury of Experts reported,
  in reference to his brasswork, that, &quot;for brilliancy of polish,
  and flatness and equality of the &#39;dead&#39; or &#39;frosted&#39;
  portions, he stood very high; and that in addition to very perfect
  workmanship, there frequently appeared considerable evidence of a
  feeling for harmony and for a just proportion and arrangement of
  parts.&quot; It is also mentioned that &quot;in the manufacture of
  metallic bedsteads he has earned a deservedly high
  reputation.&quot;</p>

  <p>In addition to his brassfoundry trade, he gradually added the
  manufacture of brass, copper, and tin tubing, gas-fittings and
  chandeliers, iron and brass bedsteads, ship&#39;s fittings, brass
  fittings for shop fronts, and general architectural ornamental metal
  work of all kinds. He afterwards purchased the large establishment
  near his own works, called the Union Rolling Mill, where he carried
  on a very extensive wholesale trade in rolled metals of every kind,
  and brass and copper wire of all descriptions; and he was, for forty
  years, largely engaged in the coal business.</p>

  <p>For a very long period Mr. Winfield was the sole proprietor of the
  extensive business he had created. He was assisted by his only son,
  Mr. John Fawkener Winfield, whose promising career was cut short by
  untimely death. This was a blow from which Mr. Winfield never
  entirely recovered. He soon afterwards took into partnership his
  relative, Mr. C. Weston, and his old confidential clerk, Mr. J.
  Atkins. His health began to fail about this time, and he retired from
  the active control of the concern, retaining, however, his position
  as head of the firm until his death.</p>

  <p>His marvellous success did not arise altogether from brilliant
  mental qualities. I am disposed to attribute it to higher reasons. It
  seems to me that his high moral sense of integrity and right, and the
  benevolence of his character, had more to do with it. These led him
  constantly through life to give his customers excellence of quality
  in the goods he made, combined with moderation in price. In the
  execution of a contract he always gave better rather than inferior
  goods than he had agreed to supply. He would never permit any
  deterioration of quality either in material or workmanship. Where his
  competitors sought to reduce the cost of production, so as to enable
  them to sell their goods cheaper, his ambition led him to raise and
  improve quality. The fact of his goods being always honestly made, of
  good materials well put together, gave him the preference whenever
  articles of sterling excellence were required. He was one to whom the
  stigma implied in the term &quot;Brummagem&quot; would not apply, for
  he consistently carried out principles of integrity in business, and
  so earned for himself the right to be held up as a type of a
  high-minded, upright, conscientious English merchant.</p>

  <p>But he had a higher and a nobler mission than that of mere
  money-getting. He was a practical philanthropist. Quietly, modestly,
  unostentatiously, &quot;he went about doing good.&quot; Placed in a
  position of command over many young people, he, early in life,
  recognised the fact that his duty to them was not fully done when he
  had paid them their wages. He resolved to do his best to raise them,
  mentally and socially. In this he was so successful, that at this
  moment there are many men occupying positions in life unattainable by
  them but for his assistance. There are clergymen, merchants, musical
  professors, and others, who began life as boys at Winfield&#39;s; and
  there are probably some scores of large manufactories now in active
  operation in the town, the principals of which, but for Mr.
  Winfield&#39;s large-hearted and practical provision, would have
  remained in the ignorance in which he found them.</p>

  <p>Some thirty or forty years ago there was, nearly opposite the
  manufactory in Cambridge Street, a long, low, upper room, which was
  used as a place of worship by a small body of Dissenters, and was
  called Zoar Chapel. Mr. Winfield became the tenant of this place for
  week-day evenings, and opened it as a night-school for the boys in
  his employ. In order to secure punctuality of attendance, he made the
  rule compulsory that every boy in the factory under eighteen years of
  age should attend this school at least three times a week. There was
  ample provision made for teaching, and no charge was made. The
  proceedings each night opened with singing, and closed with a short
  prayer. Once a week regularly, Mr. Winfield, Jun., held a Bible
  Class. Occasionally, too, the father would do so, and he frequently
  attended and delivered a short and simple address. Many parents
  eagerly sought employment for their children at the works, that their
  sons might secure the benefit of the school, and Mr. Winfield soon
  had the &quot;pick&quot; of the youths of the town. The school
  attendance grew rapidly, and the little chapel was soon found too
  narrow. Larger premises were taken, and a class for young men was
  established. This class Mr. J.F. Winfield&#8212;then rapidly rising
  to manhood&#8212;took under his own charge, while the juniors were
  under the care of voluntary teachers.</p>

  <p>So beneficial in every way was the little institution found to be,
  that it was resolved to develop it further. Mr. John
  Winfield&#8212;inheriting his father&#39;s practically benevolent
  spirit&#8212;matured a plan, and requested his father to celebrate
  his coming majority by carrying it into effect. This was done, and
  the handsome school-room which now occupies a central position in the
  works was erected. Upon this building, including the cost of an organ
  and of the necessary fittings, Mr. Winfield spent no less than
  £2,000. The instruction was no longer left to voluntary effort. A
  properly qualified schoolmaster was engaged, and the Government
  Inspector was requested to pay periodical visits. Drawing was made a
  special feature of the instruction, and the successful pupils in this
  class received Government rewards. Music also was taught. In fact,
  the school became a model of what an educational establishment should
  be. Once every year&#8212;on Whit Thursday&#8212;there was a
  <i>fête</i> at The Hawthorns, to which the scholars were invited.
  These gatherings were looked forward to with much pleasure, and few
  were absent. Music was provided, and appropriate addresses were
  delivered. Sumptuous hospitality was shown, and every effort was made
  to make these occasions socially enjoyable and morally beneficial.
  The prizes and certificates of proficiency were distributed in the
  school-room, at Christmas, in the presence of the whole of the
  <i>employés</i> of the establishment.</p>

  <p>The school soon obtained more than local fame, and was visited
  from time to time by distinguished persons. At the time of the
  establishment of the Institution of Social Science, when the great
  Lord Brougham delivered his magnificent inaugural oration in the Town
  Hall, he was the guest of Mr. J.F. Winfield, and visited the works.
  The pupils and workpeople were collected in the school, and there had
  the gratification of listening to some of the wise words of that
  &quot;old man eloquent.&quot; At this time the average nightly
  attendance at the school was something like 250 pupils. No one can
  calculate the good that has resulted from the establishment of this
  institution. No one can tell the feeling of gratitude that still
  rises in the minds of hundreds of well-to-do people for the benefits
  they there received. It has been very gratifying to me on many
  occasions to see in pleasant villas and cozy cottages the engraved
  portrait of Mr. Winfield, occupying a place of honour on the wall,
  and to hear gray-headed men say of him that he was the best friend
  they ever had, and that but for him they might have remained in the
  degradation from which he assisted them to rise.</p>

  <p>Mr. Winfield could scarcely be called a public man. Early in life
  he served the office of High Bailiff, and was placed upon the
  Commission of the Peace. He did not, upon the incorporation of the
  town, seek municipal honours, and he rarely took part in political
  action. He was a very warmly-attached member of the Church of
  England, and in this connection was ardently Conservative; but,
  although nominally a Conservative, he was truly Liberal in all
  secular affairs. He was an earnest helper in the movement for the
  better education of the people, and their elevation in other
  respects. He certainly always took the Conservative side at election
  times, but he never attempted unduly to influence his
  <i>employés</i>. Indeed, on polling days it was his habit to throw
  open the gates of his manufactory, so that his men might have full
  liberty to go and record their votes as they pleased. Whenever he did
  appear on a public platform, it was to aid by his presence or his
  advocacy the cause of the Church to which he was so much devoted, or
  to assist in some charitable or scholastic effort.</p>

  <p>As a magistrate, he was one of the most regular attendants at the
  Public Office. I have seen him there many times, and have frequently
  been struck with the thought that when he passed sentence, it never
  sounded like an expression of the revenge of society for a wrong that
  had been done, but seemed rather to resemble the sorrowing reproof of
  a father, hoping by stern discipline to restrain erring conduct in a
  disobedient child.</p>

  <p>Very early in life he married Lucy, the only surviving child of
  Mr. John Fawkener, of Shrewsbury, and took up his residence in a
  large red brick house in New Street, which has only lately been
  pulled down. It stood nearly opposite the rooms of the Society of
  Artists. Its last occupant was Mr. Sharman, professor of music. About
  the year 1828, Mr. Winfield built a house in the Ladywood Road, which
  he named &quot;The Hawthorns,&quot; and here he resided all his life.
  The neighbourhood was then entirely open, and from his house to his
  manufactory was a pleasant walk amid fields, through the noble avenue
  of elms that led to Ladywood House and Vincent Street bridge, and
  from thence by the bank of the canal to the Crescent. I often walked
  to town in his company, and admired with him the gorgeous apple
  blossoms of the trees in the valley now filled up by the railway. We
  stood together one day in 1846 or 1847, and saw the first barrowful
  of soil removed from the canal bank, near the Crescent bridge, to
  form the opening which is now the railway tunnel.</p>

  <p>In private life few men have been more generally beloved. He was
  the embodiment of kindliness and consideration for everybody. His
  domestic servants and workpeople were warmly devoted to him, and many
  of them remained nearly all their lives in his service. Only very
  recently one of his domestic servants, who had continued after his
  death in the service of a member of his family, died at an advanced
  age, fifty-five years after entering his household. He was
  essentially a &quot;domesticated&quot; man, and his conduct as a
  husband and father was marked by unvarying benevolent regard and
  affectionate consideration. The death, in 1861, of his only son was
  the great trial of his life. His hopes and his ambitions had
  culminated in this son; and when he was removed, the father staggered
  under the blow, and never properly overcame the shock it gave him.
  From that time he gradually failed in health, and retired from active
  life. Change of scene and release from labour were of no avail. He
  eventually became a confirmed invalid, and on the 16th of December,
  1869, he passed away, to the great grief of his family. His loss was
  greatly deplored by his domestics and workpeople, and the whole
  population of Birmingham joined in expressions of regret at the loss
  of one who was so universally beloved and respected.</p>

  <p>He was followed to his grave in the beautiful churchyard at Perry
  Barr by the few surviving members of his family, by many friends, and
  by the whole of the people employed at the works. The day was a
  bitter wintry one, and the rain came down heavily. It was a touching
  sight; thousands stood bare-headed beneath the inclement sky, as the
  body of their friend was laid to its rest, and, amid sobs and tears,
  joined with tremulous voices in singing&#8212;</p>

  <h2>CHARLES GEACH, M.P.</h2>

  <p>I mentioned, in the sketch of Mr. Gillott, that all the members of
  the Edgbaston Quoit Club had very large heads, and that this fact
  seemed to bear out the phrenological theory, that size of head was
  indicative of mental power. As a further proof I may mention here,
  that the late Mr. Charles Geach had the largest head in Birmingham. I
  was told by the tradesman who used to supply him with hats, that such
  was the extraordinary size of his head, that his hats had always to
  be specially made for him. The theory in his case certainly was fully
  justified, for if ever a man lived who had powerful mental qualities,
  it was the gentleman whose name stands at the head of this
  sketch.</p>

  <p>Mr. Geach was born in the county of Cornwall, in the year 1808;
  and at a suitable age took a situation as junior clerk in the head
  office of the Bank of England, in London. There, his quickness,
  accuracy, and ready grasp of complicated matters, soon proved to his
  superiors that he was no ordinary youth, and he was rapidly promoted.
  In 1826, when the branch was established in Birmingham, Captain
  Nichols, the first manager, who had noticed Geach at work, sought and
  obtained permission from the directors to include him in the staff of
  clerks which he brought down. Geach, accordingly, at the age of 18,
  came to the town with which his whole future life was destined to be
  connected.</p>

  <p>For ten years he worked assiduously as a clerk, rapidly rising in
  position at the bank, quickly attaching to himself a large circle of
  friends, and gradually securing amongst business men a character for
  industry, perseverance, sagacity, and courtesy. In 1836 he was
  engaged in the establishment of two of the local banks, and in August
  of that year he became manager of the Birmingham and Midland
  Bank.</p>

  <p>Mr. Geach, in the days of his great prosperity, often referred
  with manly pride and becoming modesty to these early days. I remember
  some twenty years ago his coming down specially from the House of
  Commons one night to take the chair, at the Temperance Hall, at a
  meeting of the Provident Clerks&#39; Association. In the course of
  his remarks that evening, he spoke of the mercantile clerks as a body
  for whom he should always feel sympathy; a class to which he felt it
  to be an honour to have once belonged, and from which he himself had
  only so recently emerged. He mentioned then, that &quot;when he first
  came to Birmingham some twenty-five years before, he did not know a
  soul in the place which had since elected him to be its Mayor, and in
  which he had, by industry and prudence, gained the esteem of so many
  friends, and achieved a position very far beyond his expectations and
  his merits.&quot; Only a very few weeks before his death, he made
  some observations of a similar character, at the annual dinner given
  by the Midland Bank Directors. Indeed, it was his frequent habit to
  point out to young men that, by the practice of habits of industry,
  prudence, diligence, and observation, success such as his&#8212;in
  kind, if not in degree&#8212;was open to them.</p>

  <p>Soon after Mr. Geach came to live in Birmingham, he took
  apartments at Handsworth. An attachment soon sprung up between him
  and the daughter of a Mr. Skally, who kept a school at Villa Cross.
  After a short courtship, the young couple were married, Mr. Geach
  then being about 24 years of age. The house in which he wooed and won
  his wife is now an inn. It stands at the angle formed by the junction
  of the Heathfield Road and the Lozells Lane; and is known by the sign
  of the Villa Cross Tavern.</p>

  <p>When the Midland Bank was opened, Mr. Geach went to reside on the
  premises, and here he lived for about ten years. He removed, about
  1846, to Wheeleys Hill, and from thence, a few years later, he went
  to reside at a large mansion at Chad Hill. For the last two or three
  years of his life he lived principally in London, occupying the
  house, No. 9, Park Street, Westminster.</p>

  <p>About the year 1840, the Park Gate Iron Manufacturing Company was
  in active operation at Rotherham, near Sheffield. Most of the shares
  were held in Birmingham, and the directors, with one exception, were
  Birmingham men. They were Joshua Scholefield, Joseph Gibbins, Henry
  Van Wart, Thomas Pemberton, Samuel A. Goddard, and Samuel Evans, of
  Cradley. For a time the company was prosperous, but about 1842 came a
  revulsion, and iron rapidly fell in price from £10 to £5 per ton. The
  company became greatly embarrassed. Most of the directors became sick
  of the concern, and lost all interest in it. The business was
  neglected by all the directors except the two last named. At one
  period the company was in such straits that their bills would have
  been dishonoured had not Mr. Goddard given his private cheque on the
  Bank of England for £3,000. At this period Mr. Geach was consulted,
  and after some negotiations he bought the whole concern for an old
  song. The nominal purchaser was Mr. Joshua Scholefield, but, somehow,
  Mr. Geach had secured for himself the largest share. The business was
  now carefully looked after, and began to recover itself. All at once
  came the &quot;railway mania&quot; of 1844 and 1845, when all England
  went mad for a time. George Hudson, the linen draper of York, from
  whom I once took an order in his little shop near the Cathedral, was
  then the most notable man in the country. He soon became known as the
  &quot;Railway King,&quot; and, as he was presumed to have the faculty
  of transforming everything into gold, he was <i>fêted</i> and almost
  worshipped by all classes of society. Under the excitement created by
  visions of untold wealth derived from making railways, iron rapidly
  rose in price to double its recent value. Mr. Geach at this time, I
  am able to state upon competent living authority, &quot;took three
  orders for 30,000 tons of railroad iron, at £12, which did not cost
  over £6 per ton.&quot; This laid the foundation of Mr. Geach&#39;s
  marvellous success, and from this period he commenced to identify
  himself with large enterprises, until at length he was associated
  with some of the most important mercantile transactions of the
  period.</p>

  <p>About this time there was living at Wednesbury an eccentric
  Independent Minister named Hardy. He is still remembered there for
  his extraordinary fancy for preaching about the &quot;seven golden
  candlesticks.&quot; When he took this topic for a sermon, his hearers
  knew that for six or seven Sundays at least he would speak of nothing
  else. And, lest his hearers should not be duly impressed with the
  subject, his practice was never to go more than a year or two without
  going over the whole ground anew. This worthy minister was somewhat
  of a mechanic, and in connection with a coach-axle maker named
  Rollason, the plan was conceived of &quot;faggoting&quot; bars of
  iron radially round a centre-bar, so that the lamin&aelig; of the iron
  should range like the concentric rings in a tree. The chief
  difficulty was the necessity of rolling the axles before they could
  be hammered. Mr. Dodd, of the Horseley Works, showed how this could
  be done by a reversing action, and Mr. Hardy patented both processes.
  Mr. H. Wright, who was afterwards a partner in the works, tells me
  that he assisted to draw up the specifications. Money being wanted to
  work the concern, a small private company was formed with a capital
  of £2,000. Mr. Hardy was manager, and Mr. T. Walker was clerk. This
  company was carried on for about two years, when, becoming involved,
  and none of the partners caring to invest more money in it,
  application was made to Mr. Geach. This was in 1838.</p>

  <p>Mr. Geach, perceiving the superiority of Hardy&#39;s method over
  any other, induced some twelve or more gentlemen to join in the
  purchase of the works and patents, Mr. Wright and Mr. Hardy being of
  the number. The new company assumed the name of the &quot;Patent
  Shaft and Axletree Company.&quot; Mr. Wright was appointed general
  manager; Mr. Hardy superintended the forge; and Mr. Walker assisted
  generally. Mr. Hardy withdrew about 1840, when Mr. Walker took the
  management of the forge. In 1841, Mr. Wright removed to Rotherham, to
  manage the Park Gate Works, and Mr. Walker became sole manager of the
  Shaft and Axletree business. In 1844, Mr. Geach bought out all the
  partners&#8212;Mr. Wright being the last&#8212;and so became the sole
  proprietor. Up to this time there had been no financial success, and
  no dividends had been paid. About this time the sudden rise in
  prices, consequent upon the railway enterprise of the period and the
  enormous demand for the manufactures of the works, turned the
  fortunes of the concern, which then commenced its career of
  marvellous success. It soon became one of the most important concerns
  in Staffordshire. It was carried on by Mr. Geach, as sole proprietor,
  until his death, when Mr. Walker purchased it. It was soon afterwards
  converted into a limited liability company, and it is now, under the
  chairmanship of Mr. Walker, who has been so long connected with it,
  one of the best conducted and most prosperous concerns in the
  district. The present number of people employed in the establishment
  is about six thousands.</p>

  <p>In addition to these two important concerns, Mr. Geach was a
  partner in a large manufactory near Dudley. He was extensively
  engaged as a contractor for several railway companies. He was an
  active promoter and director of the Manchester, Sheffield, and
  Lincolnshire, and of the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railways. He was
  also one of the <i>concessionnaires</i> of the Western Railway of
  France; and to his wonderful administrative ability and power of
  organisation the success of that company is mainly due.</p>

  <p>Although so closely connected with the railway interest, and
  although, as a proprietor in most of the leading railway companies,
  he was constantly called upon to attend meetings, his great energies
  found other spheres of action. He was a promoter, and one of the most
  active directors, of the Crystal Palace Company, at Sydenham; and he
  was a director of the Great Eastern Steam-ship Company.</p>

  <p>Busy as his commercial life was, he found time to devote to duties
  of a more public character. In 1843 or 1844 he was elected one of the
  Aldermen of Birmingham. Here he was very active and useful. Up to his
  time, the finances of the Borough had been managed with little skill
  or system. His great financial knowledge, and his clear vision of the
  right and the wrong, in public book-keeping, enabled him to suggest,
  and to carry into operation, great improvements in the management of
  the Corporation accounts. In 1847 he was Mayor, and in that office
  won the goodwill of everyone by his suavity of manner and his
  untiring industry. Two or three years afterwards, the pressure of
  other duties compelled him to retire from municipal office.</p>

  <p>It is needless to tell Birmingham men that in politics Mr. Geach
  was a Liberal. His public political life commenced at the time of the
  agitation for the repeal of the Corn Laws. During that exciting
  period he was the guiding spirit of the local Association, and
  transacted the whole of the business with the central body at
  Manchester. He was active in promoting the elections of his friends,
  Joshua and William Scholefield, with both of whom he was on terms of
  intimate friendship. His political creed was very wide and eminently
  practical. He had no abstract theories to which everything must bend.
  His eye saw at a glance the right thing to do, and he set to work
  energetically to do it, or to get it done.</p>

  <p>In the year 1851 there was a vacancy in the representation of the
  city of Coventry, and Mr. Geach was solicited to stand as a
  candidate. I saw him on the platform of the old railway station, in
  Duddeston Row, on his way to the nomination. He was very reliant, and
  spoke of the certainty he felt that he should be successful. There
  was, however, no excitement, and no undue elevation at the prospect
  of the crowning honour of his life being so near his grasp. He was
  opposed by Mr. Hubbard, the eminent London financier, and by Mr.
  Strutt, who was afterwards created Lord Belper; but he was returned
  by a considerable majority, and at a subsequent election he was
  unopposed. He held the seat until his death.</p>

  <p>In a very short time after his election, he began to take part in
  the debates. He was not a fluent speaker; indeed he was hesitating,
  and sometimes his sentences were much involved; but, as he never
  spoke except upon topics with which he was perfectly familiar, he was
  listened to with the respect and attention which are always, in the
  House of Commons, accorded to those who have &quot;something to
  say.&quot; Upon financial topics he soon was looked upon as an
  authority, and there were many who looked upon him as a possible
  future Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

  <p>Soon after his return to Parliament he became the host of the
  illustrious Hungarian patriot, Louis Kossuth. It was in Mr.
  Geach&#39;s carriage that the great exile rode triumphantly through
  the crowded streets of Birmingham, amid the plaudits of the entire
  population. Few who saw it can forget how Geach&#39;s face was
  lighted up with smiles of delight, as he sat beside Kossuth in his
  progress, with George Dawson on the box. Kossuth, albeit not unused
  to the applause and ovations of his grateful countrymen, said that he
  had never before received himself, or seen in the case of others, so
  magnificent and enthusiastic a reception.</p>

  <p>In person, Mr. Geach was tall, and stoutly built. His height was,
  probably, two or three inches beyond six feet. He had a bright,
  clear, fair complexion, and an ample brow. His face would have been
  strikingly handsome but for an undue preponderance of the under jaw,
  which gave the lower part of the face too massive an appearance. He
  had singularly agreeable manners. His grasp of the hand was firm and
  cordial. He was entirely free from the &quot;airs&quot; which some
  self-made men put on. In his appearance there was evidence of power
  and influence that rendered any assumption superfluous. He was always
  ready to listen, and to give his friends the benefit of his large
  knowledge and experience. He was very generous, even to those who had
  in early life crossed his path. Only the other day I was told that
  one of his greatest opponents having died in straitened
  circumstances, Geach took charge of his sons, and placed them in
  positions to raise themselves to opulence. In private life he was
  greatly beloved. A lady, who had ample opportunities of forming a
  correct judgment, tells me that &quot;as a husband and father his
  excellence could not be exceeded; and altogether he was the <i>very
  best</i> man I have ever known.&quot;</p>

  <p>Soon after his retirement from the management of the Midland Bank,
  the shareholders and directors, to mark their sense of his services,
  and their esteem for him as a man, voted him a magnificent service of
  plate. A fine full-length portrait was about the same time placed in
  the board room of the bank. The painting is by Partridge, and is a
  very excellent characteristic likeness of Mr. Geach in the prime of
  his life.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1854 he was somewhat enfeebled by the pressure of
  Parliamentary and commercial duties, and took a trip to Scotland to
  recruit his strength. Soon after his return to London, he was seized
  with an internal disorder, which reduced his strength very much. He
  was recovering from this attack, when a return of an old affection of
  one of his legs took place. From this time his ultimate recovery
  seemed doubtful. It was at one time contemplated to amputate the left
  foot, but in his prostrate condition this was considered unsafe and
  hopeless. He gradually became weaker, and on Wednesday, November 1st,
  1854, he died, in his 46th year. He left a widow and four children to
  mourn his loss, and a larger circle than most men possess, of
  warmly-attached friends to honour and respect his memory.</p>

  <h2>WILLIAM SANDS COX, F.R.S., &amp;c.</h2>

  <p>Rather more than thirty years ago, I was very desirous to obtain
  an influential introduction to Dr. Jephson. I mentioned my wish to an
  old friend in Birmingham, who undertook to obtain one for me, and in
  a few days told me that if I called upon Mr. Sands Cox, at his house
  in Temple Row, some morning early, that gentleman would give me a
  letter introducing me to the great Leamington physician. I
  accordingly presented myself as directed, and was shown, by a
  somewhat seedy-looking old woman&#8212;who evidently looked upon me
  with considerable suspicion&#8212;into a small room in the front of
  the house, where, seated at a writing-table, I found the subject of
  this sketch.</p>

  <p>I had expected to see a man of commanding appearance, with some
  outward indication of mental power, and with the intelligent
  brightness of eye and face which generally distinguishes men of the
  consummate skill and extensive knowledge which I was told he
  possessed. I was, however, greatly surprised to see only a
  heavy-looking, middle-aged, rather bulky man, with a miser-like
  expression of face. There was no fire in the room, and, for a cold
  morning, he seemed to be rather thinly clad, his only attire being a
  pair of trousers, without braces, and a night-shirt. The wearer had
  evidently hurried from his bed-room to his study, without the
  customary ablutions, and his tangled hair and scrubby beard were
  innocent of comb and razor. On being invited to be seated, I with
  some difficulty found a chair, for almost every square foot of
  surface in the place&#8212;floor, chairs, tables, shelves, and every
  other &quot;coign of vantage&quot;&#8212;was piled up with books,
  reports, law papers, printers&#39; proofs, and other literary matter,
  begrimed with dust, and apparently in the most hopeless condition of
  muddle. On the table itself was the opened correspondence of the day,
  and although it was very early morning, a separated portion,
  consisting of fifteen or twenty documents, and an equal number of
  letters already written, folded, and neatly addressed, showed that he
  had been early at work; whilst a large quantity of manuscript,
  thrown, sheet upon sheet, upon the floor, and the stump of a candle,
  that had burnt very low in a very dirty candlestick, proved
  conclusively that he had been hard at work until late on the previous
  night.</p>

  <p>He received me with courteous politeness, read my note, and said
  how happy he should be to comply with the request it contained;
  &quot;but,&quot; said he, &quot;you must excuse me now. I have to
  finish my correspondence, get my breakfast, and make myself a little
  more presentable. Will you call again in an hour?&quot;</p>

  <p>Of course I was punctual. I found him completely metamorphosed,
  and he now&#8212;in a soberly-cut coat of black, a brilliant black
  satin waistcoat, and white necktie&#8212;looked, as he always did in
  this dress, like a well-to-do English country clergyman. He was quite
  ready for me; handed me a very cordial recommendation to Dr. Jephson;
  and asked if he might trouble me with a small parcel for the doctor.
  I found afterwards that, in order to secure attention from a man
  whose time was so fully occupied, he had entrusted me with a
  presentation copy of a work he had just published, on &quot;The
  Amputation of a Leg at the Hip Joint,&quot; an operation which, he
  had recently, I believe for the first time in English surgery,
  successfully performed.</p>

  <p>Such was my introduction to William Sands Cox, and such the
  commencement of an acquaintance which resulted in intimacy of many
  years&#39; duration, in the course of which I had frequent
  opportunities of studying his character, and becoming acquainted with
  his many peculiarities.</p>

  <p>The family to which he belonged was one of the oldest in
  Warwickshire. His ancestors for many generations resided in the
  neighbourhood of Stratford-on-Avon. His father, the late Edward
  Townsend Cox, came to Birmingham in the latter part of the eighteenth
  century. He was articled to Mr. Kennedy of Steelhouse
  Lane&#8212;father of Rann Kennedy. He afterwards practised, with
  great success, as a surgeon, for more than half a century, dying at a
  very advanced age, only a very few years ago. His quaint figure, as
  he drove about the town in an antiquated phaeton, drawn by a
  patriarchal pony, must be familiar to the memory of all but the most
  juvenile readers.</p>

  <p>William Sands Cox was born in 1802, in the house now occupied as
  offices by Mr. Barrows, No. 38, Cannon Street. Being intended by his
  father for the medical profession, he had a most liberal education;
  and, after passing a few years as assistant to his father, he was
  sent (a most unusual course at that time) to complete his studies at
  the very best medical schools in London and on the continent.</p>

  <p>Upon his return to Birmingham, his foreign experiences enabled him
  to see that the greater number of country practitioners of that time
  were sadly deficient in medical and surgical knowledge; were
  lamentably ignorant of anatomy, pathology, and general science; and
  were greatly wanting in general culture. With rare self-denial he,
  instead of acquiring, as he easily might, a lucrative private
  practice, resolved to devote his life to the elevation of the
  character, and to the more regular and scientific education and
  instruction, of the future members of the profession to which he
  belonged.</p>

  <p>With this view, he started a modest medical and surgical
  class-room in Snow Hill. He soon collected a number of pupils, and,
  in order to secure greater accommodation, he, about the year 1830,
  removed to an old chapel in Paradise Street. This, having been
  properly fitted up, was named the &quot;School of Medicine,&quot; and
  it soon became a recognised institution. Being enriched from time to
  time by collections of medical and surgical preparations and
  appliances, it gradually grew in size and importance, and, being
  generously and very largely endowed by many benevolent persons, was
  eventually incorporated by Royal Charter as the &quot;Queen&#39;s
  College.&quot; From this time the indefatigable founder determined
  that it should be worthy of the illustrious name it bore. From his
  own resources; by his father&#39;s assistance; by the aid of many
  influential inhabitants of the town; and by persistent appeals to the
  rich and benevolent of all ranks, money was rapidly accumulated. At
  length, with the princely and munificent assistance of Dr. Warneford,
  he had the satisfaction of seeing the noble buildings that adorn
  Paradise Street completed, and the kindred institution, the
  Queen&#39;s Hospital, in full and successful operation.</p>

  <p>There was something marvellous in the power he possessed of
  influencing others. He was by no means fluent of speech; his manners
  were shy, awkward, and retiring. He had little grace of person or
  ease in conversation, yet he somehow was more successful than most
  men of his time in winning friends, and obtaining aid for the great
  work he had set himself to accomplish. Probably his indomitable
  perseverance lay at the root of the secret. How he influenced the
  good Dr. Warneford has long been matter of record. From first to
  last, I believe I am within the mark when I mention £25,000 as the
  sum which he induced Dr. Warneford to bestow upon the two
  institutions. As I write, I have before me a letter written from the
  Doctor&#39;s house to a member of the College Council, of which the
  following is a transcript:</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
    &quot;Bourton-on-the Hill, January 9th, 1852.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;My dear Sir,&#8212;I had the pleasure of submitting our
    supplemental charter this morning to Dr. Warneford. I have the
    gratification to announce a donation of £10,000.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I remain, my dear Sir, yours faithfully,<br>
    &quot;WILLIAM SANDS COX.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>The amount of labour Mr. Cox expended for the benefit of the
  Queen&#39;s Hospital was something beyond belief. Early and late he
  was busy for its advantage; thousands of autograph letters appealing
  for help fell from his pen. No chance of help was too remote for him
  to see; no one too high in rank for him to appeal to; no one so poor
  but could be asked to do something. It was he who brought Jenny Lind
  to sing gratuitously for its benefit. It was he who induced managers
  of theatres, music halls, and other places of amusement, to set apart
  certain nights as &quot;Queen&#39;s Hospital Nights.&quot; It was he
  who obtained Her Majesty&#39;s patronage and support; and &quot;last,
  but not least,&quot; it was he who organised the annual ball at the
  Town Hall, which for fifteen or twenty years was the most fashionable
  and delightful re-union in Birmingham, and which brought in a very
  large annual profit to the funds of the hospital. His appeals to
  noblemen and gentlemen to become stewards at these balls were
  literally strewed broadcast through the land. Amongst others, he was
  bold enough once to ask the great Duke of Wellington; and he used to
  show, with some pride, the letter he received in reply, which was
  written in the Duke&#39;s most characteristic manner. The original, I
  believe, still hangs, framed, in the Secretary&#39;s room at the
  hospital; and as I think it likely to be interesting, as a specimen
  of the Duke&#39;s epistolary powers and peculiarities, I append a
  copy:</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
    &quot;Strathfield Saye, Dec. 11, 1842.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;F.M. the Duke of Wellington presents his Compliments to Mr.
    Cox and regrets much that his time is so much occupied that it is
    impossible for him to be able to find leisure to attend to the
    duties of the office of a Steward of a Ball. He hopes, therefore
    that he will be excused for declining to be nominated to fill an
    office the duties of which he cannot undertake to perform.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;W. Sands Cox, Eqre.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>The last time I saw Mr. Cox, in connection with these
  institutions, was in 1862, at the time of the great bazaar on behalf
  of the hospital. It was a hard week&#39;s work for many, and it
  resulted in a profit of about £3,500. Mr. Cox&#39;s homely figure
  during that week, was &quot;here, there, and everywhere,&quot;
  encouraging everybody, and assisting in every way, even to helping
  the college porter to carry large and heavy hampers of goods across
  the street from the college to the Town Hall. I have a perfect
  remembrance of his sitting, on the last day of the bazaar, with
  another gentleman, in the ticket office, to receive the sixpenny fees
  for admission. I recollect then to have seen again the strange,
  miserly expression which had struck me at my first introduction; and
  I noticed, too, the eager &quot;clutch,&quot; with which he grasped
  the money as it came in, and how he chuckled with delight as he made
  up into brown paper parcels each pound&#39;s worth of silver as it
  accumulated. How, too, his eyes twinkled; how he rubbed his hands
  backwards and forwards over his mouth, as he jerked out &quot;Another
  pound, Mr. &#8212;&#8212;; I believe we shall get £50&quot;; and how,
  when the doors were closed, he triumphantly handed over to the
  treasurer more than sixty packets, of £1 each, as the result of the
  sixpences paid for admission on that one day.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, his mind was <i>creative</i> only. Like many
  parents, who never can be brought to understand that there comes a
  time when their children are <i>mentally</i> capable of &quot;running
  alone,&quot; he, in his later years, failed to see that these two
  institutions, the children of his brain, no longer required leading
  strings, or his <i>unaided</i> nursing. Hence, as the establishments
  grew beyond his personal power of supervision, he became jealous of
  everyone connected with their management, and sought still to be sole
  director. As the founder, his will was to be absolute law; everybody
  must consult his wishes, and bow to his decision; and although he
  had, with advancing years, become less capable, and had always been
  wanting in the <i>sustaining</i> power which successfully <i>carries
  on</i> great work, he insisted upon regulating every matter of detail
  and discipline connected with the two institutions.</p>

  <p>The result was inevitable. Difficulty after difficulty arose. A
  painful disease at this time attacked him, making him more irritable
  and exacting. Professors and other officers of the college retired
  one after the other. Friends fell off. Subscriptions were dropped.
  Pupils were withdrawn, and complete anarchy prevailed. At length
  Chancery was appealed to, and Mr. Cox, having been defeated, retired,
  somewhat sulkily and disdainfully, from the town&#8212;disappointed,
  dejected, dispirited, and with a feeling which embittered the
  remaining years of his life&#8212;a feeling that he had been very
  greatly misunderstood, and most ungratefully treated.</p>

  <p>Sands Cox, in private life, was gentleness and simplicity itself.
  At a dinner party, while ladies were present, he was very quiet; but
  the merry twinkle of his eye when the conversation became animated,
  showed that he was keenly alive to all that was going on. After the
  ladies had retired, he generally joined in the conversation, and had,
  almost always, some quaintly curious story, which, told, as it always
  was, in a shy way, as a schoolboy might tell it, was irresistibly
  droll.</p>

  <p>He had few amusements. He was fond of a quiet rubber; kept a tame
  monkey, whose grotesque antics were to him a perpetual source of
  gratification; and he was very fond of fishing. With the fly rod he
  was very skilful, and he would occasionally steal a few days&#39;
  holiday to indulge in trout or salmon fishing. He did not disdain,
  however, the far humbler sport that lay within an easy reach of
  Birmingham, and I occasionally went with him to a favourite spot for
  perch fishing. On one occasion, by an accident, he lost his bagful of
  baits, and had to use some of mine. Finding it inconvenient to come
  to me every time he wanted to bait his hook afresh, he took half the
  worms from my bag, which he crammed&#8212;all slimy and crawling as
  they were&#8212;into the pocket of a nearly new satin waistcoat. At
  another time, just as he was about to put on a fresh bait, his line
  became entangled in a bush, so as to require both hands to disengage
  it. Without the slightest hesitation he put the worm into his mouth
  to hold it while his hands were engaged with the line, and he seemed
  greatly to enjoy the laughter which his queer proceeding forced from
  those who were present.</p>

  <p>In the course of his professional career, many honours were
  bestowed upon him. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society; was
  elected a member of the French Institute; and was honorary member of
  nearly every important surgical school in Europe. He was also created
  magistrate and Deputy-Lieutenant for the County of Warwick. He had,
  though few knew it, considerable influence in quarters where his name
  might hardly be expected to be known. He was generally consulted as
  to the fitness of local gentlemen proposed for magisterial honours;
  and as none of the parties are now alive, I may state that some days
  before the Queen&#39;s visit to Birmingham, in 1858, it was to Mr.
  Cox that application was made for information respecting the then
  Mayor, upon whom there was some hesitation as to whether the honour
  of knighthood should be conferred. Mr. Cox suggested, in reply, that
  the honour, although of course nominally given to the Mayor, would
  really be granted as a compliment to the town, which had chosen him
  as the chief magistrate. Acting on this suggestion, the Government of
  the day, as is well known, decided on the honour being bestowed.</p>

  <p>I have alluded to some indications of a miserly disposition in Mr.
  Cox. These were, at the time, a psychological puzzle to my mind; but
  I have learned since that a man may have strong acquisitive
  instincts, and yet be without selfishness; that he may be even greedy
  to acquire, and yet deny himself in almost every possible way, in
  order to benefit others; and that the faculties of benevolence and
  conscientiousness will, in many cases, direct into unselfish channels
  the riches which have been accumulated by the mere animal instinct of
  selfish acquisitiveness.</p>

  <p>Such is a faithful and honest attempt to exhibit something of the
  character, habits, and manners of one of Birmingham&#39;s most worthy
  sons; a man who, whatever his faults and failings, did much to
  elevate the noble profession to which he belonged, and thereby to
  alleviate the sufferings of thousands of his fellow creatures, not
  only of his own time, but for generations to come. To him,
  unquestionably, we owe the existence of two of our noblest
  institutions&#8212;the Queen&#39;s College and Hospital; and yet,
  strange to say, the town possesses no memorial of him. Others, who
  have done comparatively little for the place, have their portraits in
  the Corporation Gallery; yet Sands Cox is unrepresented. Surely the
  time has arrived when this should be remedied; surely, now that the
  grave has closed over his remains, the irritation and ill-feeling
  created by his somewhat imperious will and dogmatic manner, should be
  forgiven and forgotten, and only his self-denying devotion to the
  good of his native town should be remembered. Surely it is not too
  late to see that some fitting memorial of the man, and his work,
  should show to posterity that his contemporaries, and their immediate
  successors, were not unmindful of, nor ungrateful for, the great and
  noble work he was privileged to accomplish.</p>

  <h2>GEORGE EDMONDS.</h2>

  <p>In the early part of the present century, a house, which is still
  standing, in Kenion Street, was occupied by a Dissenting Minister,
  who had two sons. One of these sons, fifty years afterwards, told the
  following story:</p>

  <div class="blockquote">&quot;When I was a boy, I was going one evening up Constitution
  Hill. On the left-hand side, at that time, there was a raised
  footpath, protected by railings, similar to the one which now exists
  at Hockley Hill. I was on the elevated part, and heard some one
  running behind me. Upon turning, I found a soldier, out of breath,
  and so exhausted that he sank to the ground at my feet. He implored
  me not to give information, and asked me for protection, telling me
  that he had been sentenced, for some neglect of duty, to receive a
  large number of lashes, at certain intervals, of which he had already
  been indulged with one instalment. Having been thought incapable of
  moving, he had not been very closely watched, and he had just escaped
  from the barracks, having run all the way to the spot on which he had
  fallen. I took him home, and told my father, who was greatly alarmed;
  but he fed him, and sent him to bed. The next morning I dressed
  myself in the soldier&#39;s clothes, and danced before my father, as
  he lay in bed. He was angry and alarmed, particularly as, on looking
  out of the window, we saw a non-commissioned officer of the same
  regiment standing opposite, apparently watching the house. Nothing
  came of that; but the difficulty was, what to do with the man. At
  night, however, we dressed him in some of my clothes, and sent him
  off to Liverpool. He promised to write, but we never heard any more
  of him. His clothes were tied up in two bundles; my brother James
  took one, and I the other, and we walked with my father to Hockley
  Pool, where we loaded the bundles with bricks, and threw them into a
  deep part of the water.&quot;</div><a name="image-0003" id=

  <p>The narrator of this story, and the chief actor in the simple
  drama was George Edmonds. I mention this little event because it
  shows that the spirit of hostility to tyranny, and the scorn of
  oppression, cruelty, and persecution, which he manifested in his
  after life, were inborn, and a part of his nature. The same noble
  spirit which induced him, like the good Samaritan, to bind up the
  wounds, and to succour and defend the friendless soldier, gave his
  tongue the eloquence, and his soul the fire, to denounce, in the
  presence of assembled thousands, the malpractices of those then in
  power, and the injustice of the laws under which the people
  groaned.</p>

  <p>George Edmonds was born in the year 1788, at the house in Kenion
  Street of which I have spoken. His father was the Minister of the
  Baptist Chapel in Bond Street. He was very popular as a preacher, and
  he appears to have been a man of much culture. An engraved portrait
  of him may be seen in the window of Mr. Massey&#39;s shop at the top
  of Mount Street. He was possessed of considerable humour, and was
  almost as celebrated as the great Rowland Hill for making droll
  remarks in the pulpit. It is told of him that, reading the fourth
  chapter of <i>Philippians</i>, and coming to the thirteenth verse, he
  read, &quot;I can do all things;&quot; here he paused, and said,
  &quot;What, Paul?&#8212;do all things? I&#39;ll bet you half-a-crown
  of it;&quot; then, suiting the action to the word, he placed the coin
  on the leaf of the book; but on reading the concluding portion of the
  verse, he said, &quot;Oh, that alters it! I withdraw the bet,&quot;
  and then went on with his reading.</p>

  <p>Under his father&#39;s care, George Edmonds received a really good
  education, and became an excellent classical scholar. His knowledge
  of Greek was extensive and profound. He was not apprenticed or
  articled to any business or profession, and he appears to have
  devoted his early manhood entirely to study. His favourite pursuit
  was the science of language, and in this branch of learning he became
  probably one of the best-informed men of his day. He was in constant
  correspondence with the most eminent and learned philologians of his
  time. I shall have occasion, further on, to mention this topic
  again.</p>

  <p>In the year 1823, I find that he was keeping a school in Bond
  Street, near the chapel; his pupils, no doubt, being mainly the sons
  of the members of the congregation. This life appears to have been,
  to him, somewhat of a drudgery; and he longed for more active duties,
  and a larger sphere of work. At that time the strict etiquette which
  now governs all legal matters did not exist. The young schoolmaster
  having volunteered on one occasion to assist a friend to conduct a
  case in the old &quot;Court of Bequests,&quot; found the self-imposed
  task very much to his taste. He took up the profession of an
  Advocate, and in that court and the magistrates&#39; room at the
  Public Office he soon became a busy man. His clear insight gave him
  the power of instantly possessing himself of the merits of a case,
  while his fluency of speech, his persuasive manner, and his
  scholastic acquirements were great advantages. He soon obtained
  considerable influence among the respectable old gentlemen who at
  that time sat as judges in the one court and magistrates in the
  other. His intense love of fun, and his powerful irony, made these
  courts, instead of dull and dreary places, lively and cheerful. Many
  droll stories are told of him, one of the best of which relates to
  his cross-examination of a pompous witness. Edmonds began by asking,
  &quot;What are you, Mr. Jones?&quot; &quot;Hi har a
  skulemaster,&quot; was the reply. In an instant came the crushing
  retort from Edmonds, &quot;Ho, you ham, his you?&quot; He continued
  to practise in the Court of Bequests until it was abolished, but he
  was ineligible in the newly-established County Court, not being an
  attorney. He then articled himself to Mr. Edwin Wright, and in the
  year 1847 was admitted as a solicitor, which profession he followed
  actively, up to the time of the illness which removed him from public
  life.</p>

  <p>He was a powerful and successful advocate. His fault, however, in
  this capacity was that he identified himself too much with his case.
  He seemed always determined to win. True justice and fairness were
  not considered, so long as he could gain the day. Hence, when another
  advocate was opposed to him, the matter assumed, generally, the
  aspect of a professional tournament, in which victory was to be
  gained, rather than that of a calm and impartial investigation, in
  which the truth was to be ascertained and a just award made.</p>

  <p>At the time of the incorporation of the town in 1838, and the
  establishment of Quarter Sessions, Mr. Edmonds was appointed Clerk of
  the Peace. He was then seriously ill, and was supposed to be dying.
  It was understood at the time, that the appointment was made as a
  solace to him in his then condition, and as a recognition, which
  would be pleasant to him, of the services he had rendered to his
  native town. It was not expected that he would survive to undertake
  the duties of the office. He, however, lived to perform them for more
  than thirty years. He himself had so little expectation of recovery
  that, from what he supposed to be his dying bed, he wrote to Mr.
  William Morgan, urging him to announce himself as a candidate for the
  office, so soon, in all probability, to become vacant. Mr. Morgan
  refrained from so doing, and Mr. Edmonds nominated him his deputy. In
  that capacity Mr. Morgan acted at the first Sessions held in the
  town.</p>

  <p>As years rolled on, Mr. Edmonds became at times very absent in
  mind, causing occasionally great merriment in court by the ludicrous
  mistakes he made. When the Sessions-room was altered a few years ago,
  the jury box was placed on the opposite side of the court to that it
  had formerly occupied, but Mr. Edmonds&#39;s mind never realised the
  change. While juries were considering their verdict, it was Mr.
  Edmonds&#39;s practice to engage in conversation with some of the
  barristers; and he sometimes became so lost in these discussions as
  to take no heed of his duties. Mr. Hill, the Recorder, enjoyed these
  little scenes intensely. On one occasion, when the jury was waiting
  to deliver a verdict, the Recorder had to call him from one of these
  little chats, to receive it. Edmonds turned to the old spot, and
  seeing no one there, said, &quot;There is no jury, sir.&quot; Upon
  which, Mr. Hill, smiling, said, &quot;If you&#39;ll turn round, Mr.
  Edmonds, you&#39;ll see the jury laughing at you.&quot; In some
  confusion, Edmonds turned round, and, his mind being somewhat
  uncollected, he asked, &quot;What say you, Mr. Foreman, are you
  guilty or not guilty?&quot; On another occasion he took up, by
  mistake, from his desk, an indictment against a man who had been
  tried and sentenced, and charging the prisoner, who was a female,
  read, &quot;John Smith, you stand indicted,&quot; &amp;c. The
  Recorder, jocularly rebuking him, said he had never known a woman
  named John Smith before. The woman was sent down, and Edmonds
  insisted in having the real John Smith up, and he again began the
  charge. The prisoner laughed in his face, and told him he had been
  tried once, and got ten years, but he wouldn&#39;t mind being tried
  again if the judge would make it five.</p>

  <p>But George Edmonds had a higher claim to grateful recollection
  than could be based upon mere forensic skill or professional duty.
  His it was to help to apply the first impulse to the movement which
  eventually broke down the strong bulwarks of territorial oligarchy.
  His it was to wear the political martyr&#39;s crown; his to beard a
  profligate Court, and a despotic, tyrannical, and corrupt Government;
  his to win, or to help to win, far nobler victories than were ever
  gained by Marlborough or Wellington: victories of which we reap the
  benefits now, in liberty of thought and speech, in an unfettered
  Press, in an incorrupt Parliament, in wiser laws, and in unshackled
  commerce. His manly voice never counselled aught but obedience; but
  it was never silent until it had assisted to ensure for his
  fellow-countrymen, that the laws he taught them to obey were just and
  impartial, and were equitably administered.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Edmonds was a mere child, the great Revolution in France
  gave the English advocates of freedom hopes that the &quot;appointed
  time&quot; would soon arrive. The obstinacy of the King, which had
  already caused the loss of America, once more made itself manifest,
  and crushed these hopes. War was declared against France in 1793, and
  (with the exception of a period of thirteen months, from March, 1802,
  to April, 1803, and a few months in 1814-15) raged until the Battle
  of Waterloo, in June, 1815. Daring the whole of this long period the
  hopes of English freedom lay dormant. With the return of external
  peace came fresh visions of internal reformation. Major Cartwright,
  Sir Francis Burdett, and other advanced politicians formed themselves
  into a society, which, in memory of one of England&#39;s most worthy
  sons, they named the Hampden Club. They advocated annual Parliaments,
  universal suffrage, and vote by ballot. Provincial reformers adopted
  their creed. George Edmonds, then some 27 years old, took up the
  cause with great zeal, and advocated it with much eloquence and
  fervour. Cobbett, by his writings, and Hunt, by his speeches, aided
  the movement. The Tory party was alarmed, and Lord Liverpool&#39;s
  Government was so exasperated, that a crusade against the popular
  cause was resolved on.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Hampden Club counselled their Birmingham friends to
  bring matters to an issue, by electing a &quot;Legislatorial
  Attorney,&quot; who was to proceed to the House of Commons, and
  formally demand to be admitted as the representative of Birmingham.
  The advice was taken, and on the 12th of July, 1819, a great meeting
  was held on Newhall Hill, for the purpose indicated. George Edmonds
  was the chairman and principal speaker, and was admittedly the local
  leader.</p>

  <p>The Government was not slow to take action. On the 30th of the
  same month, the Prince Regent issued a proclamation, warning all His
  Majesty&#39;s subjects against treasonable and seditious meetings,
  and malpractices generally, and saying, <i>inter alia</i>&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
<p>
    &quot;And whereas, it hath been represented unto us, that at one of
    such meetings the persons there assembled, in gross violation of
    the law, did attempt to constitute and appoint, and did, as much as
    in them lay, constitute and appoint, a person then nominated, to
    sit in their name, and in their behalf, in the Commons House of
    Parliament; and there is reason to believe that other meetings are
    about to be held for the like unlawful purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    &quot;And whereas, many wicked and seditious writings have been
    printed, published, and industriously circulated, &amp;c.
  </p>

  <p>
    &quot;And whereas, we have been given to understand ... that in
    some parts of the kingdom, men, clandestinely and unlawfully
    assembled, have practised military training and exercise.
  </p>

  <p>
    &quot;And whereas, &amp;c., we have resolved to repress the wicked,
    seditious, and treasonable practices, &amp;c. We do charge and
    command all sheriffs, magistrates, &amp;c., to discover and bring
    to justice, all persons who <i>have been</i> or may be guilty of
    uttering seditious speeches or harangues, and all persons concerned
    in any riots or <i>unlawful assemblies</i>, which, <i>on whatever
    pretext they may be grounded</i>, are not only <i>contrary to
    law</i>, but dangerous to the most important interests of the
    kingdom,&quot; &amp;c.
  </p></div>

  <p>At the time this Proclamation appeared, Edmonds was editing and
  publishing in Birmingham a weekly political paper, under the title of
  <i>Edmonds&#39;s Weekly Recorder</i>. Number 8 of this paper, dated
  August 7, 1819, lies before me. The Proclamation is printed at full
  length on the front page, and the next column contains the opening
  sentences of a letter from Edmonds to the Prince Regent. This letter
  is of great length, and is written in a well-supported strain of
  splendid irony all through. To copy it at length would occupy too
  much space. I may, however, be allowed to quote a short extract or
  two. Speaking of the meeting on the 12th July, of which he
  acknowledges himself to have been the chairman, he says: &quot;I, and
  may it please you, sir, being a very loyal man, was very careful,
  although it was quite unnecessary, to admonish the people to obey the
  laws; and I can assure you, sir, that I have not heard of a single
  instance of disloyalty, or violation of the laws, which occurred
  during the said meeting. And while we are upon the subject, permit
  me, sir, to lament that your Royal Highness did not in your Royal
  Proclamation lay down the <i>law</i> which had been violated by the
  people of Birmingham.&quot; &quot;Finding, however, contrary to our
  expectations, that your Royal Highness considers that we have acted
  unlawfully, we must humbly petition that the <i>precise law we have
  violated</i> may be pointed out, that we may not, through ignorance,
  be led to do wrong again. Some persons have supposed the
  <i>Proclamation</i> to be <i>law</i>, but I have said to them, &#39;A
  Proclamation is a <i>Proclamation</i>, and <i>not the law of
  Parliament</i>.&#39; In the same manner as your Highness profoundly
  speaks, in your Royal Proclamation, of those &#39;unlawful
  assemblies&#39; which are &#39;contrary to law.&#39; Truisms, an
  please your Royal Highness, are much better than
  falsehoods.&quot;</p>

  <p>The number of the <i>Weekly Recorder</i> for August 14th, 1819,
  contains a long address to his &quot;Fellow-townsmen,&quot; signed by
  George Edmonds. It commences by stating that &quot;the last week has
  been a very important one in the annals of Warwickshire, and indeed
  of England.... Five of us, Major Cartwright, Mr. Wooler, Mr. Lewis,
  Mr. Maddocks, and myself, have had true bills found against us for a
  conspiracy to elect a Member of Parliament, and at the next Assizes
  the indictment will be tried.&quot;</p>

  <p>The grand jury brought in the &quot;true bill&quot; on Monday,
  August 9th. The trial did not take place at the Assizes then being
  held, and the indictment was afterwards removed by <i>certiorari</i>
  into the Court of King&#39;s Bench. It came on for trial at Warwick,
  on August 7th, 1820, before the Lord Chief Baron Richards. When the
  special jury was called, only four answered to their names. Mr.
  Barber was the foreman, and on taking the book into his hands, one of
  the defendants asked him whether he had &quot;ever expressed any
  opinion as to the merits or demerits of this case.&quot; The Judge
  interfered, and said that &quot;as a <i>special</i> juryman he was
  not bound to answer the question.&quot; Eight names were then added
  from the common jury list, and the trial proceeded. Denman was
  counsel for Edmonds, and Matthew Davenport Hill for Major Cartwright.
  The others defended themselves in person. The Judge summed up
  unfavourably, and after twenty minutes&#39; deliberation the jury
  gave a verdict of guilty against all the defendants. Judgment,
  however, was deferred.</p>

  <p>On May 28, 1821, the Attorney-General moved the judgment of the
  court. The Lord Chief Justice Abbott, afterwards Lord Tenterden,
  recapitulated the arguments as to the legality of the jury, and held
  that no legal challenge could have been made until a full jury
  appeared; and as in this case the challenges had been made before the
  full jury had assembled, there were no grounds for a new trial.
  Several motions in arrest of judgment were subsequently made, but
  eventually Mr. Edmonds was sentenced to twelve months&#39;
  imprisonment in the common gaol of the county, and he was thereupon
  removed to Warwick, where, within the walls of the gaol, he spent
  every minute of the period for which he had been sentenced.</p>

  <p>Upon his restoration to liberty, he published the following
  characteristic advertisement in the Birmingham newspapers:</p>

  <div class="blockquote"><p>
    &quot;George Edmonds begs to inform his <i>friends</i>, his
    <i>enemies</i>, and the <i>public</i>, that on leaving Warwick Jail
    he recommenced his profession of a schoolmaster; that by the zeal
    of his patrons he has succeeded beyond his most sanguine
    expectations; that he has taken for a period of seven years those
    extensive premises opposite Bond Street Chapel, and that the school
    re-opened on Monday last.
  </p>

  <p>
    &quot;The public are respectfully referred by G.E. to his
    <i>enemies</i> as the judges of his capacity to <i>instruct</i> and
    <i>correct</i>.... To his <i>enemies</i>&#8212;if it be possible
    that he can have any&#8212;G.E. offers the most entire absolution
    for their sins against the <i>best of men</i>, on the following
    most reasonable terms: That they henceforth zealously trumpet forth
    his merits; and on his part he agrees to receive their children at
    his academy, as hostages for the performance of these conditions.
    <i>Quid rides</i>?
  </p>

  <p>
    &quot;Bond Street, July 2, 1823.&quot;
  </p></div>

  <p>Mr. Edmonds&#39;s trial, so far from impeding the popular cause,
  gave it a forward impetus. It was contended that the jury had been
  improperly impanelled; and Mr. Peel, afterwards Sir Robert, was
  compelled to admit in the House of Commons that such was the case, as
  the panel did not contain the proper number of names. The great
  Jeremy Bentham took up the case, and published a pamphlet impugning
  the legality of the whole proceedings, and exposing the utter sham of
  the special jury system. Peel, much to his honour, brought into the
  House, and carried, a bill to amend the whole jury system, and thus
  Edmonds&#39;s trial led to the abolition of a great public scandal
  and a national grievance.</p>

  <p>Henceforward, Edmonds was the recognised leader of the Birmingham
  Radicals, and the agitation for Parliamentary Reform commenced anew.
  The Whigs, though favourable, held aloof, looking upon it as a
  hopeless case. In the year 1827, Mr. Charles Tennyson, afterwards
  known as Mr. Tennyson D&#39;Eyncourt, proposed to the House of
  Commons that the two seats forfeited by the disfranchised borough of
  East Retford should be transferred to Birmingham. The proposition was
  supported by Sir James Mackintosh and others, but was eventually
  negatived. The mere proposition, however, revived the dying embers of
  Birmingham political life. All classes, and all sections of
  politicians, hailed the proposal with delight. Tories, Whigs, and
  Radicals united in a requisition to Mr. George Attwood, who was then
  High Bailiff, to hold a town&#39;s meeting, which was held
  accordingly on June 25th, 1827, at Beardsworth&#39;s Repository. At
  this meeting, resolutions in favour of Mr. Tennyson&#39;s proposition
  were proposed and seconded by gentlemen belonging to the three
  parties, Tories, Whigs, and Radicals. A committee, thirty-two in
  number, composed of men of all shades of opinion, was appointed to
  work in support of the enfranchisement of the town. Edmonds&#39;s
  name was left out for strategic reasons: a convicted conspirator, it
  was thought, would do the cause no good. He, however, endorsed the
  scheme heartily, worked energetically, and spoke frequently and
  eloquently in its favour.</p>

  <p>The proposition, as I have said, was negatived by the House of
  Commons, but it had borne good fruit in Birmingham. Henceforth the
  timid Whigs came once more into the sunlight of political life; and
  the Tories, being divided in opinion on the measure, split into two
  sections, with the result that the <i>ultra</i> party, which had
  monopolised all municipal power, was broken up. Prom this time united
  action became possible, and more reasonable relations were
  established between the active and the passive Liberals. The extreme
  Radical section, seeing that the men of moderate views had joined in
  the movement for the Reform of Parliament, became less extravagant in
  their demands. On the 14th of December, 1829, sixteen gentlemen,
  called together by circular, met at the Royal Hotel, and founded the
  great Political Union. Rules having been prepared, it was proposed to
  hold a Town&#39;s Meeting, under the presidency of the High
  Bailiff&#8212;Mr. William Chance&#8212;to ratify them. That
  gentleman, on the proposal being made to him, stated that he could
  not view it as &quot;any part of his duty to call a meeting of the
  inhabitants of the town for any such purpose.&quot; The meeting was,
  notwithstanding, held at Beardsworth&#39;s Repository, on the 25th
  January, 1830, Mr. G.F. Muntz being chairman. About 15,000 persons
  were present, and a number of resolutions, embodying the principles
  and objects of the new organisation, were proposed and carried; some
  &quot;unanimously,&quot; some with &quot;one dissentient,&quot; and
  some &quot;by a majority of at least one thousand and one;&quot; and
  the &quot;General Political Union between the Lower and Middle
  Classes of the People,&quot; became an accomplished fact.</p>

  <p>From this time, for more than three years, nearly the whole of Mr.
  Edmonds&#39;s time was devoted to the cause he had so much at heart.
  Night after night, and month after month, he fanned the flame of
  popular feeling, until it culminated in the unparalleled meetings on
  Newhall Hill. At the one held on May 14th, 1832, there were nearly
  200,000 persons present. Mr. Attwood occupied the chair, and the
  proceedings commenced by the vast assembly singing a hymn composed
  for the occasion by the Rev. Hugh Hutton, the two final verses of
  which were as follow:</p>

  <div style="margin-left: 10%;">
  &quot;God is our guide! From field, from wave,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The plough, the anvil, and the loom,</span><br>
  We come, our country&#39;s rights to save,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And speak a tyrant faction&#39;s doom.</span><br>
  And hark! we raise, from sea to sea,<br>
  Our sacred watchword, Liberty!<br><br>

  &quot;God is our guide! No sword we draw,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">We kindle not war&#39;s fatal fires;</span><br>
  By union, justice, reason, law,<br>
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">We claim the birthright of our sires!</span><br>
  And thus we raise from sea to sea,<br>
  Our sacred watchword, Liberty!&quot;<br>
</div>

  <p>At this meeting, what has been described as &quot;one of the most
  solemn spectacles ever seen in the world&quot; took place. After it
  had been determined to petition the House of Lords &quot;not to drive
  to despair a high-minded, generous, and fearless people,&quot; Mr.
  Clutton Salt took off his hat, and, calling upon the people to follow
  his example, the entire assembly stood uncovered as they repeated
  after him the Union vow: &quot;In unbroken faith, through every peril
  and privation, we devote ourselves and our children to our
  country&#39;s cause.&quot; The sound of the thousands of voices in
  unison, as they uttered these words, has been described as resembling
  the sound of the waves of the sea on a rocky shore.</p>

  <p>Earl Grey, on the adverse vote of the House of Lords, had resigned
  on the 9th of May. The Duke of Wellington and Sir R. Peel endeavoured
  to form a Government, but failed utterly; so that on the 18th, Earl
  Grey returned to power. &quot;At the personal request of the King, a
  large number of the Tory peers consented to absent themselves from
  the House of Lords during the further discussion of the Reform
  Bill.&quot; &quot;By the first week of August the bills had received
  the Royal assent, and the political excitement which had kept the
  country agitated for nearly two years was suddenly changed into
  complete listlessness and apathy.&quot;</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the personal sacrifices which Mr. Edmonds had made, and
  the sufferings he had endured, were not unheeded by his friends. On
  April 25th, 1831, a meeting was held, under the presidency of Mr.
  John Betts, at which it was resolved to raise a subscription in his
  behalf, in recognition of &quot;his superior talents, his tried
  integrity, and the persevering industry with which he has, for a long
  series of years, devoted himself to the great cause of public
  liberty, and more especially to the rights, privileges, and welfare
  of his fellow-townsmen.&quot; Mr. Thomas Attwood was appointed the
  treasurer, and a committee of twenty of the leading Liberals of the
  town took charge of the movement, which resulted in a handsome sum
  being presented to Mr. Edmonds.</p>

  <p>Mr. Edmonds was not one to become politically listless and
  apathetic. He considered the passing of the Reform Bill to be only
  the stepping-stone to other beneficial measures. At his instigation
  it was resolved that the Political Union should not be dissolved, but
  should be &quot;kept firmly united.&quot; On May 20th, 1833, another
  monster meeting was held on Newhall Hill, at which the Government was
  censured for passing the Irish Coercion Bill; for refusing the right
  to vote by ballot; for persevering in unjust and cruel Corn Laws; and
  for continuing the House and Window Taxes.</p>

  <p>George Edmonds was one of the most active agitators for the grant
  of a Charter of Incorporation to the town. He was generally selected
  to be either proposer or seconder of the Reform candidates, at the
  elections. Few political meetings of any kind, were held at which he
  was not only present, but took an active part; and even when old age
  had bent his frame and weakened the tones of his once trumpet-like
  voice, he would occasionally make the walls of the Town Hall ring, as
  he denounced oppression, or called upon his fellow-townsmen to rise
  to vindicate a right. His spoken addresses were singularly clear and
  forcible in their construction. His language was very simple, and was
  nearly pure Saxon, and his enunciation of every syllable of each word
  distinct and perfect. He was a born politician, and a bold and
  fearless leader. He had a very genial disposition, and a charitable
  heart; but was impulsive, and was very strong in his resentments. He
  was what Dr. Johnson might call &quot;a good hater.&quot; He combined
  the fierceness of the lion with the gentleness and docility of the
  lamb.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, I have spoken of Mr. Edmonds chiefly in reference to his
  professional career and his political activity. I now turn to a phase
  of his character which is little known, but which is not in any way
  less remarkable. As a scholar and a philologian he had rare
  abilities, and a rarer industry. Having, somewhat early in life,
  possessed himself of a copy of the works of Dr. Wilkins, who was a
  bishop in the reign of Charles II., he became impressed with the
  thought that a universal language was within the bounds of human
  possibility, and he set himself diligently to work out the problem.
  During the whole of his busy political life; all through his active
  professional career; amid the strife and the worry, the turmoil, and
  the rancour, of the controversy in which he was so prominent; it was
  his habit to rise from his bed at three or four o&#39;clock in the
  morning to endeavour to master this intricate task. In the failures
  of others who had essayed this gigantic work, he saw only incentives
  to fresh exertions. Nothing daunted him. Failing to find in ordinary
  type, as used by printers, the necessary symbols to embody his
  thoughts, he, at enormous expense, had an entirely new fount, from
  his own designs, made expressly for the book which was to be the
  crowning monument of his life. Finding no printing-office willing to
  undertake a work of so unaccustomed a nature, he fitted up a room in
  his house in Whittall Street, and here, by his own hands, the whole
  of the type was set. Mr. Massey, of Friday Bridge, informs me that he
  <i>printed</i> the book, and he has obligingly placed at my disposal
  a few specimens of the peculiar types used. The result was, a thick
  quarto volume, every page of which bristles with evidences of acute
  erudition, and the most accurate reasoning and discernment. It bears
  the title of &quot;A Universal Alphabet, Grammar, and Language,&quot;
  and it has for a motto a text from the book of
  <i>Zephaniah</i>&#8212;&quot;For then will I turn to the people a
  <i>pure language</i>, that they may call upon the name of the
  Lord.&quot;</p>

  <p>He seems to have aimed at the production of an &quot;Alphabet of
  Characters,&quot; which should indicate the various sounds of the
  voice, and he succeeded. &quot;I thought,&quot; he says, in the
  preface to his book, &quot;and still think it, theoretically, a near
  approach to perfection. Into this character I translated the whole of
  St. Matthew&#39;s Gospel, and various extracts from the <i>Psalms</i>
  and other books.&quot; &quot;With great reluctance, and not without
  much pain,&quot; he came to the conclusion that this system was
  impracticable, and he &quot;therefore gave up the idea altogether of
  that character, and looked about for some other.&quot; It then
  occurred to him that the Roman alphabet &quot;might be supplemented
  by certain marks, so as to represent all the elementary sounds;&quot;
  and this resulted in his compiling an alphabet containing forty
  symbols, of which five&#8212;<i>ai, au, oi, ou</i>, and <i>oo</i> are
  compounds; the remaining thirty-five are the ordinary letters, some
  of which have marks under them, like the dash we make under a word in
  writing to indicate greater force or emphasis, thus&#8212;U D Z o d
  z.</p>

  <p>Having arrived at this point, he intimates his belief that his
  next discovery was the result of direct inspiration. &quot;I am far
  from superstitious, yet I must confess, with regard to this
  discovery, I have long felt as though I had been no more than a mere
  instrument, accomplishing the will of Another; and that the direction
  of my thoughts, and my ultimate convictions, were only a part of the
  development of my own mind, enforced and controlled by some internal
  law, which ensured its own effects without any original exercise of
  my own reason. One thing is certain: I cannot tell how it was brought
  into my own i mind, and I have no recollection of the process which
  ultimately revealed to me a knowledge of the power and essential
  importance of the discovery.&quot;</p>

  <p>The discovery of which he speaks is that the &quot;success of the
  Philosophic [language] turned upon the proper use of two short vowels
  and three nasal consonants. These are the short <i>u</i>, as in
  faithful, and the <i>i</i> in pin, and the consonants, <i>m, n</i>,
  and <i>n</i> [i.e., <i>ng</i>]. One of these three consonants is to be
  found in the centre of every root of the [philosophic] language. They
  resemble the reed in the hautboy&#8212;they give B metallic ring in
  the words where they occur. They may be compared to the sound of the
  trumpet in a concert; the other consonants are the sound of the
  drum&#8212;rub-a-dub-dub.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is of course impossible, in a short notice like this, to give a
  thousandth part of the methods and arguments by which Mr. Edmonds
  works out his theory; but I shall attempt to make his process clear
  by one or two short examples.</p>

  <p>He starts by assuming that, as all words are reducible to nouns as
  a first principle, so the whole of the nouns can be classified into
  forty &quot;genera.&quot; These genera are each divisible into
  &quot;differences,&quot; and the differences are sub-divisible into
  &quot;species.&quot; He gives a list of the &quot;genera,&quot; each
  of which is composed of two vowels and two consonants; and then, in a
  series of very elaborate tables, he proceeds to show how words of
  every possible signification can be built up from the materials thus
  provided and classified. For instance, amongst the genera,
  <i>onji</i> is the root-word for insects, <i>anji</i> for fish,
  <i>enji</i> for birds, and <i>inji</i> for beasts. Taking
  <i>anji</i>&#8212;or fish&#8212;for my example, because it is the
  shortest, I may mention that he divides fish into nine
  &quot;differences,&quot; two of viviparous, five of oviparous, one of
  crustacea, and one of scaly river fish. I will give one example of
  each class, merely pointing out that the letters <i>anj</i> occur in
  the middle of each name. The final letters give the <i>species</i>,
  and the initials the <i>specific fish</i> indicated, thus:
  <i>Panjoo</i> is whale, <i>Banjoi</i> is skate, <i>Danjo</i> is
  herring, <i>Kanja</i> is gurnet, <i>Danji</i> is sea-perch,
  <i>Danjai</i> is eel, <i>Banjino</i> is plaice, <i>Vanjoinoi</i> is
  star-fish, and <i>Fanjino</i> is salmon.</p>

  <p>The same process of building up words from simple roots is carried
  on all through the whole range of thought and action; and the result
  as a whole is that, as a theoretical system, the entire subject is
  successfully worked out.</p>

  <p>Whether it will ever be carried out in practice is extremely
  doubtful. Some Spanish enthusiasts were so enraptured with Mr.
  Edmonds&#39;s book that they sought and obtained an interview with
  the late Emperor Napoleon, with a view to secure his patronage of the
  new scheme. The expression of his opinion was short, but shrewd. He
  said the only way to establish universal language was to first
  establish universal empire; and that, he thought, would not be
  possible just yet.</p>

  <p>In July, 1867, Mr. Edmonds, when 79 years of age, married, at the
  Old Church, Leamington, as his second wife, Miss Mary Fairfax, of
  Barford, near Warwick, the descendant of a truly noble family. She
  was 75 years of age at the time. Their natures and dispositions,
  however, being so very dissimilar, this proved to be an unhappy
  union, and after living together three weeks only, they separated by
  mutual consent. His mind at this time&#8212;and, indeed, for some
  previous time&#8212;must have been giving way. Eventually, he was
  placed in the asylum at Winson Green. From thence he was removed to a
  private asylum at Northampton, where he died in the year 1868, being
  80 years of age.</p>

  <p>His funeral at the General Cemetery was attended by most of the
  leading Liberals of the town, and by great crowds of admirers.
  Charles Vince, who was so soon to follow him, delivered a very
  eloquent address over the open grave, in which he said, &quot;For the
  firmness with which he maintained his convictions, and for the zeal
  and ability with which he advocated them, he will always have a name
  and a place in the history of his native town, if not in the history
  of his country. To the honour of his memory it will be said that he
  held his opinions honestly; laboured for them diligently; devoted
  great gifts and rare energy to their promotion; and amply proved his
  sincerity, and won the crown of the conscientious, by the things that
  he suffered.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is, in my opinion, not very creditable to the Liberal party in
  the town that George Edmonds has no public memorial. The generation
  passing away may remember his face and figure; but before it goes, it
  has a duty to its successors to perform. That duty is to leave some
  lasting memorial, in the shape of a statue, bust, or portrait, of the
  man, who, sacrificing his own freedom, helped thereby to gain for his
  countrymen liberty of thought, liberty of speech, and liberty to
  carry on in the future the beneficent policy which he advocated with,
  so much eloquence and perseverance.</p>

  <h2>THE EARLY DAYS OF CHARLES VINCE.</h2>

  <p>With reverent pen and loving spirit, I sit down to write of one
  whose sunny smile brightened every circle upon which it shone; whose
  massive intellect and clear mental vision discovered subtle truths
  and deep symbolic meanings in common things; whose winning and
  graphic eloquence made these truths and meanings clear to others,
  showing them that not a blade of grass springs by the roadside, nor
  an insect flutters for a day in the gladdening light of the
  spring-time, but has its lesson, if men will but search for it, of
  tender mercy and fatherly care. His broad and catholic spirit was
  wide enough to embrace within his friendship men of widely divergent
  thought and belief. His life was one long and eloquent lesson to us
  all. If ever man deserved the blessing following the words,
  &quot;Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these, my
  brethren, ye did it unto me,&quot; that man was Charles Vince, for of
  him, more emphatically than can be said of most of us, it may be
  recorded that &quot;he went about doing good.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is not necessary to sketch the mature character of one so
  recently taken from amongst us. The shadow of his homely figure has
  scarcely faded from our streets, and the sound of his eloquent voice
  still seems to vibrate in our ears. It seems but yesterday that, on
  that cold and cheerless day, his lifeless but honoured remains were
  borne to the grave through the crowds of sympathising people who
  thronged the busy streets to see the last of him they knew so well
  and loved so heartily. Little could be added to the warm tributes
  that were paid so recently to the memory of the gifted, truthful,
  fearless, earnest, hard-working Christian teacher, who, in the prime
  of his life and the zenith of his powers, was removed from the sphere
  which he adorned by the purity of his character, and benefited by the
  power and graces of his intellect.</p>

  <p>But these tributes referred mainly to what he was, and what he
  did, in the later part of his career, and in the maturity of his
  powers. In some of them the references to his parentage, his birth,
  and his boyhood, were singularly inaccurate. In one periodical of
  large circulation and great influence, statements full of error and
  misrepresentation went forth to the world unchallenged. It is my
  purpose, therefore, in this paper, to correct the mistakes of those
  who wrote, being imperfectly informed; and to give, as I had it from
  the lips of his friends, his schoolfellows, and his relatives, a
  simple, but at all events a strictly accurate, record of the few and
  unromantic events of the early days of one who became so fruitful in
  goodness and in charity.</p>

  <p>With the view that this little sketch should at least be free from
  serious error, I made, the other day, a special pilgrimage to
  Vince&#39;s birthplace&#8212;the pleasant town of Farnham in Surrey.
  I stood before the lowly cottage in which he first drew breath; I sat
  in the little room where his father and his mother taught him
  practical lessons of truthfulness and sympathy; I looked into the
  little plain deal cupboard his father made for him, in which he
  stored the books he loved so well and studied so intently. I talked
  with his schoolfellows and the companions of his boyish days, and
  listened to those who were the chosen friends of his youth-hood, and
  I noted the brightening of the eye, and the more fervid tones of the
  voice, as one after another told me of the budding intellect, and of
  the germination of the warm and tender spirit, of him they were all
  so proud of.</p>

  <p>After a long continuance of cold and cheerless weather, the
  morning of Saturday, the 26th of May, 1877, was bright and genial. An
  unclouded sun, and a warm south-western wind, awoke the birds to
  melody, and gave the flowers new fragrance. As the train bore me
  through pleasant Surrey, the fields not only smiled&#8212;they
  absolutely seemed to laugh with joy at the advent of the first day of
  summer, and when we stopped at the pretty station of plutocratic
  Surbiton, the air was laden with the perfume of lilacs and of
  hawthorn blossom. From a dense thicket, nearly overhead, came
  cheerfully the melodious notes of &quot;the careful thrush,&quot;
  who, as Browning says&#8212;</p>

  <div style="margin-left: 10%;">
       <span style="margin-left: 4em;">&quot;Sings his song thrice over,<br></span>
  Lest I should think he never could recapture<br>
  That first, fine, careless rapture.&quot;<br>
</div>

  <p>As the train passes on, I see, beyond the silvery Thames, the
  stately front of Hampton Court Palace. A little further on we pass
  Esher, where, on a tree-girt hill, the lofty pediment of Claremont
  peeps through the trees, and reminds me that here, sixty years ago,
  the hopes of England were quenched by the death of the youthful
  Princess Charlotte. Strange, that this house should have been the
  death-place of the unthroned heiress of England, and, forty years
  afterwards, of the dethroned crafty old French king, Louis
  Philippe.</p>

  <p>When we stop at Woking Common, I feel at home. Here,
  half-a-century ago, when there was not even a hut on the spot which
  is now a busy town, I used to play as a boy. Yonder is the
  Basingstoke canal, where, with willow wand and line of string from
  village shop, I used to beguile the credulous gudgeon and the greedy
  perch. Just up that lane to the right, on the road to Knap
  Hill&#8212;famed the world over for its hundreds of acres of
  rhododendrons&#8212;is the nurseryman&#39;s shed to which, in the
  summer, cart-loads of the small, wild, black cherries came from
  Normandy, for seed. Here the boys of the neighbourhood had the
  privilege of gorging themselves gratis with the luscious fruit, on
  the simple condition that they placed the cherry-stones in bowls
  provided for the purpose. As the train moves on, we dash through a
  deep cutting of yellow-coloured sand, and emerge upon a wild and
  dreary region. On the hills to the right are a gaol, a reformatory,
  and a lunatic asylum; and on the left is the &quot;Necropolis,&quot;
  where London, in the black and sandy soil, deposits the myriads of
  its dead. All around, the ground is olive-coloured with unblossomed
  heath, bright and golden here and there with the flowerets of the
  prickly gorse. Dense and dismal plantations of black-looking Scotch
  firs are enlivened at intervals by the delicate and tender green
  spikelets of a sprouting larch. On we rush for miles through this
  sombre region, through dank morasses, and past dark and gloomy pools,
  from one of which a heron rises majestically. On, until, in a broad
  and airy region, the red coats of soldiers are seen dotted here and
  there amongst the heather. In the distance are the serried lines of
  the tents of Aldershot. Just beyond this point the train suddenly
  enters the chalk formation, and comes simultaneously into a
  cultivated district. A mile or two further, and the train stops at
  Farnham; birthplace of Toplady, who wrote the beautiful hymn,
  &quot;Rock of Ages;&quot; of William Cobbett, sturdiest of English
  yeomen; and of Charles Vince, who, coming to Birmingham an utter
  stranger, so endeared himself to its people, that he was universally
  beloved; and when he died, was followed to his grave by thousands of
  the principal inhabitants, amid the tearful regrets of the entire
  population.</p>

  <p>As I leave the station, and approach the town, I see on my left,
  nestling under a cliff, an old timbered house, bearing on its front
  the inscription, &quot;Cobbett&#39;s birthplace.&quot; It is an inn,
  and I enter in search of refreshment. A somewhat surly man appears,
  and tells me that he &quot;ain&#39;t got no cold meat.&quot; I
  persevere, and am told that I <i>can</i> have some bread and cheese,
  which are accordingly served. I ask the landlord&#8212;for such the
  man is&#8212;if there are any relics of Cobbett remaining in the
  house? The reply is, &quot;not as I knows on.&quot; I am told,
  however, that he is buried in the churchyard hard by, and that his
  grave is &quot;right agen the front door,&quot; and this is all the
  man knew, or cared to tell, about the matter.</p>

  <p>The most striking peculiarity of Farnham, as seen from the cliff
  behind the &quot;Jolly Farmer,&quot; is the abundance of hop gardens.
  As far as the eye can reach, in all directions, little else appears
  to be cultivated. At the time I visited it, the appearance was very
  singular. From the tops of distant hills; creeping down into the
  valleys; even to the back doors of the houses in the principal
  street, the whole surface of the earth seemed clothed with stiff
  bristles. About two thousand acres of land in this parish alone are
  planted with hop bines, and as each acre takes three thousand
  hop-poles to support the climbing crop, it follows that there were
  five or six millions of these poles standing bare and upright before
  the astonished eye. No wonder that a conical hill at a little
  distance looked like a gigantic hedgehog.</p>

  <p>At the extreme westerly end of the main street of the town there
  is a small house on the left, standing some twenty feet back from the
  line of the other buildings. The space between the house and the
  street is now covered by a conservatory. A greenhouse adjoins the
  house on the west side, and a large piece of ground fronting the
  street for some distance is occupied as a nursery, and, when I saw
  it, was gay with flowers and verdure. In the year 1823 this house,
  together with a large plot of adjoining land (now built upon), was
  the property of Charles Vince&#39;s father, and in this little house
  Charles Vince was born. The father was by trade a builder and
  carpenter, and was very skilful. If he had any intricate work on
  hand, it was his habit to go to bed, even in the day-time, in order
  that he might, undisturbed, work out in his mind the proper means of
  accomplishing the end in view. He held a sort of duplex position. He
  was foreman to, and &quot;the life and soul of the business&quot; of,
  Messrs. Mason and Jackson, builders; but he had a private connection
  of his own, which he worked independently. He was greatly liked, and
  the late Sir George Barlow, a landed proprietor of the neighbourhood,
  made him a kind of factotum on his estate. He seems to have been a
  very original character; to have had superior abilities as an
  artificer; and to have had most of the qualities which go to form
  what is called a &quot;successful&quot; man. He was, however, a bad
  financier; he did not understand &quot;business;&quot; and so he went
  on through life, contented to remain where he was; his abilities
  securing to him competence and comfort; enabling him to give his
  children a good education; and to maintain his position as a
  respectable and worthy member of society. He had something of the old
  Puritan about him, and was &quot;brimful of fun and humour.&quot; He
  was very original in speech and thought, and he was very earnest in
  his religious life and practice. A good story was told me of his
  quaint manner. At the chapel of which he was a member, one of the
  ministers having died, a successor was appointed, who in some way
  caused a division amongst his people, some of whom seceded. Mr.
  Vince, senior, remained. Some weeks afterwards it was decided by
  those who still held to the old chapel that it would be better for
  the minister to leave, but this decision was not made public. A few
  days after, one of the seceders, meeting Vince, said, &quot;I
  understand you&#39;re going to buy your minister a new pulpit
  gown.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; was the reply, &quot;you&#39;ve missed
  it; we&#39;re going to buy him a <i>new travelling
  cloak</i>.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Vince, senior, was a member of a very good family in Sussex,
  and was a woman of superior mental powers. She is described as a very
  industrious, careful, motherly woman; one to whom all the neighbours
  applied for advice and assistance in any trouble or emergency, and
  never in vain, for her heart was full of sympathy and her brain of
  fertility of resource. She was a pious, humble, God-fearing woman,
  who did her duty; trained her children carefully; set them the
  example of a truthful, practical, and loving Christian life; and had
  the satisfaction of seeing the results of her excellent example and
  precepts carried into full life and activity in the career of her
  only son.</p>

  <p>Such were the parents of Charles Vince, and such the influences
  which surrounded his childhood. He was a bright, intelligent boy; he
  never had any trouble with his lessons, and was remarkably quick in
  arithmetic. His father was very proud of him, and he was sent to the
  best school in the place. It was kept by a nephew of the celebrated
  William Cobbett. &quot;Tommy&quot; Cobbett, as he was always called,
  seems to have been a favourable specimen of a country schoolmaster in
  those days. On his leaving the town, about 1837 or 1838, a Mr.
  Harrington took his place, and Charles Vince remained as a pupil for
  a time, but Harrington went to old Mr. Vince to say that he felt he
  was dishonest in taking his money, for &quot;Charles ought to take my
  place and teach me.&quot;</p>

  <p>Upon leaving school, Charles was duly bound apprentice to Messrs.
  Mason and Jackson, where he was taught by his father. Without
  indentures of apprenticeship in those days, an artificer had no
  status in his trade; yet it would seem, in this case, that the
  &quot;binding&quot; was regarded by each party as little more than a
  necessary formality, for the youth did not spend the whole of his
  time in the service of his nominal employers. He was always with his
  father, and Sir George Barlow took a great fancy to him. He worked on
  at his trade, however, for some years, and only left the
  workman&#39;s bench to assume the vocation of a teacher.</p>

  <p>His parents were members of the Congregational Chapel in the
  place, and their son was a constant attendant at the Sunday school,
  first as a scholar and afterwards as a teacher. When he was about 17
  or 18 years of age, one of his relatives, and the then master of the
  British School in the place, conceived the idea of establishing a
  Mechanics&#39; Institute. Vince joined the movement with ardour, and
  the little institution was soon an accomplished fact. A grammar
  class, to which Vince attached himself, was very popular among the
  young men of the town, and they soon after established a debating
  club. Here the latent talents in Vince developed themselves. He
  became a fluent speaker, and was soon asked to deliver a lecture.
  Being half a poet himself, he chose Poetry as his topic, and seems to
  have given himself up to the preparation of his subject with a
  determination to succeed. One of his old I companions (whose towering
  head, by the way, would be a splendid artist&#39;s &quot;study&quot;
  for an apostle) told me that at this time they read together
  &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; a great part of which he said he could
  still repeat from memory. Vince used to declaim aloud the
  &quot;bits&quot; that pleased him, and &quot;he was never tired&quot;
  of the passage in the tenth book, where the poet, describing the
  change which followed the Fall, says&#8212;</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 10%;">
  &quot;Some say He bid His angels turn askance
  The poles of Earth some ten degrees or more
  From the sun&#39;s axle; they with labour pushed
  Oblique the centric globe,...
  ...to bring in change
  Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring
  Perpetual smiled on Earth with verdant flowers,
  Equal in days and nights.&quot;
</div>

  <p>The condition of his mind at this time was so eloquently described
  to me by this friend, that I shall quote his words as I took them
  down from his own lips: &quot;To ordinary appearance his mind was
  like a common flower; with beauty, perhaps, that would not catch the
  unobservant eye; but intimate as I was, I could discover in his
  homely talk, beauties that those who only knew him slightly could not
  observe, because he kept his petals closed. He did not open to many,
  but I saw, or thought I saw, the germs of what he afterwards
  became.&quot;</p>

  <p>The lecture was a great success, and the conductors of the Sunday
  school had no difficulty afterwards in persuading him to give short
  addresses to the children. He appears about this time to have decided
  to become a preacher, and his character became deepened and
  intensified by the determination. This is so well described in a
  letter from Farnham that I shall again quote: &quot;When he first
  fully made up his mind to give his attention to preaching and
  teaching, he and I were deputed to visit a village about an
  hour&#39;s walk from this town to canvass the houses, and see if a
  Sunday school could be established. I remember it was about this time
  of the year, and with what delight my friend seemed to drink in all
  the beauties of Nature on that quiet Sunday morning. <i>He seemed, to
  look on these things with new eyes</i>; and he often, in years long
  after, referred in sermons and in speeches to that Sunday
  morning&#39;s walk.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Sunday school was established, and here, &quot;in one of
  Surrey&#39;s prettiest villages,&quot; Vince preached his first
  sermon in a cottage.</p>

  <p>At this time, too, he became a politician, taking his lessons and
  forming his political creed from a most unlikely source, apparently.
  This was the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>, a paper that in those days was
  scarcely thought to be proper reading for young people. He read it,
  however, with avidity, and there is no doubt that it had much to do
  with forming his political character, and in laying the foundation of
  the sturdy inflexibility with which he held to his political
  principles. One of his early friends says, &quot;He liked the
  <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>. The politics, being racy, had a great
  attraction for him, and he used to drink them in
  ravenously.&quot;</p>

  <p>From this time he was the &quot;pet speaker&quot; of the place.
  His lectures at the Mechanics&#39; Institute were delivered
  frequently, and became immensely popular. The lecture-room was far
  too small for the eager listeners who crowded to hear him. &quot;A
  large market room&quot; was taken, and here, when he lectured, there
  was no space for many who wished to hear him. He preached on Sundays
  in the villages around, and at length was asked to occupy a pulpit in
  Farnham itself. &quot;I remember,&quot; says one of his friends,
  &quot;his first sermon in the old Congregational Chapel. The place
  was crammed to excess, by people too who were not in the habit of
  attending such places.&quot;</p>

  <p>All this time, this &quot;carpenter, and son of a carpenter,&quot;
  worked diligently at his trade; but a sudden vacancy occurring in the
  management of the Farnham British Schools, he was asked to become the
  master. He did so. He left the carpenter&#39;s bench on a Saturday,
  and became schoolmaster on the following Monday. This, however, was
  but a temporary arrangement, for he was at the time negotiating with
  the managers of Stepney College to become a pupil there; and, an
  opportunity shortly afterwards occurring, which he had very promptly
  to accept or refuse, he somewhat abruptly vacated his seat as a
  schoolmaster, and became once more a scholar.</p>

  <p>This was in 1848. He remained in the college four years, and he
  soon learned to laugh heartily at his Farnham Latin and his Farnham
  lectures. He was in the habit, while at the college, of going on
  Sundays to hear the best preachers in the Metropolis, and he has told
  me that he often walked from Stepney to Camberwell to hear Melvill,
  who was then the most popular preacher in London.</p>

  <p>At the end of his academic career he was invited to become the
  minister at Mount Zion Chapel, in Birmingham. How he laboured here
  every one in the town can testify, and I need not say one word; but
  there is one fact that should be more generally known, as it shows
  one result of his work. In the year before he came to Birmingham
  (1851), the sum collected in this chapel for the Baptist Missions was
  £28 4s. 11d. The report for 1874&#8212;the last under his
  care&#8212;gives the amount collected in the year as £332 5s. 5d.</p>

  <p>I am obliged to omit much that is interesting, but I have at least
  shown that his childhood&#39;s home was comfortable and respectable,
  and that he did not spend his boyhood among companions unworthy of
  him. In his native town his memory is as warmly cherished as it is in
  Birmingham. His last public act there was to preach the first sermon
  in a new and remarkably handsome Congregational Church, and it is
  said that on that occasion, the number of people who sought to hear
  him was so great, that the Church, although a spacious one, would not
  contain the half of them. &quot;There was no room to receive them;
  no, not so much as about the door.&quot;</p>

  <p>A handsome gothic cross has recently been erected over Vince&#39;s
  grave. It bears the following inscription:</p>

TO THE MEMORY OF
CHARLES VINCE,
BORN, JULY 6, 1824; DIED, OCTOBER 22, 1874:
  WHO FOR TWENTY-TWO TEARS WAS THE MINISTER OF GRAHAM STREET
CHAPEL, IN THIS TOWN.

As a Preacher
of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, his teaching was especially
characterised by perfect faith in the infinite love
and mercy of God, and by deep and tender sympathy with the hopes,
the sorrows, and the struggles of men.
As a Citizen,
his generous zeal for the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed,
made him the strenuous advocate of all efforts for
social and political reform.
The sweetness of his nature, the purity of his life,
and the manliness and simplicity of his character, compelled the respect
and attracted the friendship of those who differed from him.
His courage, integrity, courtesy, and charity,
won the affection, and his eloquence commanded the admiration,
of all classes of his fellow-townsmen,
by whom this memorial is erected as a tribute to his
personal worth and public services.

  <h2>JOHN SMITH, SOLICITOR</h2>
<br>

    <p>Everybody in Birmingham knew &quot;Jack Smith, the lawyer.&quot; It was
    something worth remembering to see him drive up New Street in the
    morning on his way to his office. Everything about his equipage was
    in keeping. The really beautiful pair of ponies; the elaborate
    silver-trimmed brown harness; the delicate ivory-handled whip; the
    elegant little carriage; the smart boy-groom behind; and the radiant
    owner in front. Most carefully, too, was the owner &quot;got up.&quot; His white
    hat; his well-fitting coat, with its gay flowers in the button-hole;
    his scrupulously clean linen; the bright buff waistcoat; the blue
    necktie, and the diamond pin, all seemed to harmonise with his broad,
    merry, brown face as he passed along, with a sort of triumphant air,
    glancing from side to side, and greeting with a roguish, happy-looking
    smile such of the foot passengers as he happened to know. Everybody
    turned to look at him; and most people looked as if they felt it to be
    a compliment to be recognised by him in the street.</p>

    <p>John Smith was the son of Mr. Dyer Berry Smith, a printer, engraver,
    and wholesale stationer in a very extensive way of business in
    Prospect Row. Forty or fifty years ago his firm was known all over the
    country, for they printed the bill-heads for nearly every grocer in
    the kingdom, the imprint, &quot;Smith and Greaves, sc.,&quot; being prominent
    on every one. John was born in Prospect Row, in the year 1819. He
    was intended by his father for the medical profession, and spent some
    years in preliminary studies. He was exceedingly fond of chemistry, in
    which he became very proficient, and the study of which continued to
    be a favourite pursuit all his life. He had also considerable skill as
    an anatomist, and it is known that, within a few years of his death,
    having caught a mole in his garden, he dissected it most skilfully,
    with a view to discover the peculiarities of the eyes and optic nerves
    of that singular animal. His knowledge of chemical and medical
    science was, in after life, of great service to him. No doubt it was a
    considerable <i>factor</i> in the marvellous defence he made of Palmer,
    the Rugeley poisoner, which, though unsuccessful, was universally
    considered amongst lawyers to have been a masterpiece of professional
    skill.</p>

    <p>Having abandoned the idea of becoming a medical practitioner, as not
    affording scope for his energetic spirit, he was articled to the
    late Mr. Alexander Harrison, the solicitor. Immediately after
    the expiration of his articles, Smith made his appearance in the
    Bankruptcy Court as an Advocate. In this capacity he showed very great
    tact, and an intimate knowledge of every minute point of practice. His
    pleasant voice and manner soon made him a favourite; and he applied
    himself to this branch of his profession with such success, that it
    may be said that down to his death there was scarcely a bankruptcy
    case of any importance in the Birmingham Court in which he was not
    professionally engaged on one side or the other.</p>

    <p>He possessed consummate ability, an imperturbable temper, and
    great confidence in himself. His marvellous coolness under the most
    embarrassing circumstances, his quickness of apprehension, his ready
    wit, and his boundless fertility of resource, have won him many
    a legal victory. It is but justice, however, to add that his easy
    notions as to truthfulness occasionally carried him over difficulties
    which would have been insurmountable by a man of more acute moral
    sense.</p>

    <p>His memory was very tenacious. I had once a very remarkable instance
    of this. I was dining at the &quot;Acorn&quot; one Monday, and Smith was there.
    He came to me after the cloth was cleared, and said, &quot;Didn&#39;t I see you
    at Vince&#39;s Chapel last night?&quot; On my replying in the affirmative, he
    began to eulogise the sermon, which he said he had repeated the night
    before, word for word, to some friends at his house, after he got
    home. Knowing his failing, I smiled incredulously, but he began
    immediately to recite the sermon <i>verbatim</i>, and I verily believe that
    he could have gone through the whole without a mistake of a single
    word.</p>

    <p>It is well known that he was often short of money. On one occasion he
    wrote to George Edmonds, asking for a loan of seven pounds, adding,
    &quot;on Wednesday I will faithfully promise to repay you.&quot; Edmonds sent
    the money, and on Wednesday called at Smith&#39;s office, expecting to be
    repaid. After the usual civilities, Edmonds asked for the cash. Smith
    affected to be ignorant, but on Edmonds saying, &quot;Well, I&#39;ve got your
    note promising to repay me to-day,&quot; said, &quot;Let&#39;s look at it, old
    fellow; there must be some mistake.&quot; The note was produced, and after
    reading it, Smith said, &quot;I thought you must be wrong, and I find it
    is so; this note says that &#39;on Wednesday I will&#39;&#8212;what? Pay? No.
    &#39;Faithfully promise.&#39; Well, I do now faithfully promise to repay you,
    but Heaven knows when you&#39;ll get the money.&quot;</p>

    <p>Some years ago one of the Banks brought an action against some one
    who owed them money, and Smith was retained for the defence. He first
    attempted to compromise the action, but he found that his client had
    in some way so annoyed the directors and the manager, that they would
    not entertain any proposition; the case therefore stood for trial
    at Warwick Assizes. Smith hit upon a very novel expedient. He caused
    subp&oelig;nas to be served upon every clerk in the bank and upon the
    manager. The latter had what is technically called a <i>subp&oelig;na duces
    tecum</i>, in virtue of which he was under an obligation to produce at
    Warwick the whole of the books of the establishment. This caused great
    dismay, it being seen that if the trial were to go on, the business of
    the bank must be entirely suspended. The result was that Smith&#39;s terms
    were accepted, and the action was settled.</p>

    <p>During the &quot;railway mania&quot; of 1845 a company was formed in Birmingham
    for making a railway from Wolverhampton to Birkenhead, and Smith was
    its solicitor. The company, like many others, &quot;came to grief.&quot; The
    directors were great losers, and much litigation followed. In those
    days there were no &quot;winding up&quot; arrangements, and the creditors of
    defunct companies had to sue individual directors to recover the
    amount of their claims. One action in connection with this company
    came on for trial at Warwick, in 1847 or 1848, before the late Mr.
    Justice Patteson. Mr. M. (the present Justice M.) was counsel for
    the defence, and Smith was a witness for the plaintiff. The Judge was
    deaf, and Smith&#39;s loud voice and clear replies evidently pleased him.
    He complimented Smith, who was soon in one of his best humours,
    his broad, merry face beaming with smiling good-nature. His
    examination-in-chief being over, Mr. M. got up, prospectus in hand,
    and majestically waving a pair of gold eye-glasses, said, &quot;Well, Mr.
    Smith, I see by this prospectus that the solicitor of this company
    is John Smith, <i>Esquire</i>, Upper Temple Street, Birmingham; are <i>you</i>
    &#39;John Smith, <i>Esquire</i>?&#39;&quot;</p>

    <p>Smith (with great energy): &quot;I AM!&quot;</p>

    <p>Mr. M. (evidently disconcerted): &quot;Oh! very good, Mr. Smith; very good!
    H&#39;m! I see by your prospectus that you had a large number of persons
    connected with you in this matter. You had, I see, Parliamentary
    agents, solicitors, London solicitors, local solicitors, consulting
    engineers, acting engineers, surveyors, auditors, secretary, and a
    variety of other officers. Had you standing counsel, Mr. Smith?&quot;</p>

    <p>Smith (folding his arms, and with the greatest possible coolness):
    &quot;No, we hadn&#39;t, Mr. M.; but I remember the subject being discussed
    at one of our board meetings, and I mentioned your name as that of
    a rising young man at the Bar, and there was some idea of retaining
    you.&quot;</p>

    <p>The effect was electrical. Everybody in court was convulsed with
    laughter. The judge put down his pen, threw himself back in his chair,
    and laughed until he shook like a piece of <i>blancmange</i>. As soon as
    he could recover himself, he asked, in tones tremulous with suppressed
    mirth, &quot;Are you satisfied, Mr. M.?&quot; Mr. M. was completely nonplussed;
    could make no defence; tried to &quot;rub it off&quot; by delivering himself of
    a homily upon the degradation it was to the Bar of England that
    some of its members should be capable of lending themselves to the
    promotion of &quot;Bubble Companies;&quot; but it would not do. He lost his
    temper; he lost his case; and it was many years before he heard the
    last of it.</p>

    <p>Some friends of mine had been directors of this company, and I had a
    good deal to do with winding it up. Smith&#39;s bill was a curiosity.
    Two items in it are probably unsurpassed in the whole records of the
    taxing masters&#39; offices. They were as follows:</p>

      hundred applicants for shares, and twelve hundred<br>

      their respective neighbourhoods&#8212;say, two thousand<br>
      attendances, at six and eightpence each</td>

      each</td>

	<td>300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;0</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

    <p>It is needless to say that the greater part of these charges was
    disallowed.</p>

    <p>I met him one morning on the platform of the old Duddeston Row
    Station. We were both going to London. He proposed that we should ride
    together, but as I had taken a second-class ticket and he a first, I
    pointed out the difficulty. &quot;Oh, never mind,&quot; said he; &quot;come in here,
    they never charge extra for any friends of mine;&quot; so I was persuaded
    to go in his carriage. We were alone, and he kept me laughing the
    whole of the way. On arriving at Camden Town, where the tickets were
    then collected, I took from my purse the amount of the excess fare, so
    as to be in readiness for the collector. As soon as he appeared at the
    window, Smith set up an unearthly scream; put on a most extraordinary
    expression of face; and feigned madness. This behaviour so frightened
    the poor collector, that, keeping his eye fixed upon Smith, he
    mechanically held out his hand; took my ticket without looking at it;
    and hurried from the carriage, evidently congratulating himself upon a
    lucky escape.</p>

    <p>Smith occasionally got into trouble with the &quot;powers that be;&quot; and in
    one case, where he was obstinate, an &quot;attachment&quot; was issued, under
    which he was confined for a few days in Coventry Gaol. He became, in
    a day or two, the life and soul of the place. I was shown a letter
    written by him from prison to the opposing solicitor, asking him to go
    over to arrange terms of settlement. &quot;You can come at any time,&quot; wrote
    Smith; &quot;you&#39;ll be sure to find me at home.&quot;</p>

    <p>He certainly was no common man, and but for one or two unfortunate
    deficiencies in his character, he might have risen to great heights
    in his profession. He had abilities of no common order, and he had
    a &quot;taking&quot; way that was very fascinating. Even those who knew his
    failings, and could hardly accord him their <i>respect</i>, could not help
    <i>liking</i> the man. His somewhat untimely and sudden death caused much
    regret. On the morning of September 23rd, 1867, in accordance with
    his usual practice, he went for a ride on horseback, returning to his
    house in Sir Harry&#39;s Road about half-past ten. Feeling somewhat faint,
    he retired to his room; a fit of apoplexy supervened. Mr. Samuel
    Berry, and Mr. Oliver Pemberton, were hastily summoned. On their
    arrival, Smith was found to be insensible, and by twelve o&#39;clock at
    noon he had ceased to breathe. He was in his 49th year.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
